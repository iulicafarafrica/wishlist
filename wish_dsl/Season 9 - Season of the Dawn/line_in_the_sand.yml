      Ages ago, Fallout put out a
      [Crooked Fang God Roll video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB-s1IYDpeQ)
      and lo' and behold, Line in the Sand is basically an Arc Crooked Fang! So
      let's get to taking their command out one by... We can rely on that review
      for some solid tips. Is it a PvP workhorse? Nah but fun is fun so if you
      like LFRs, go nuts.

      Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons
      [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we
      approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice,
      but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what
      will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you
      an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
