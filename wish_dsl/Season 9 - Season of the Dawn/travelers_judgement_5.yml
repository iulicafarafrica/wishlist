      CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)!
      There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with
      Disruption Break which works in PvP (?!) Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger
      being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few of these.
      Keep in mind TJ5 doesn't benefit from from the Season 9 R92 additional
      perk in the last slot, so these rolls are *tough* to get.  Recently, True
      Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08)
      and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls.

          Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and TtT procs on every other burst.
          Going for max range after that. This is going to be an incredibly hard
          roll to get, so buy a lottery ticket if it lands for you.

          Disruption Break works in PvP apparently!? Same set of rolls as above,
          but pairing with Disruption Break instead of Tap the Trigger.

      These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)
      above. Disruption Break, who knew? CoolGuy makes a great point: we might
      see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks like Barrier can be
      applied to sidearms and since Barrier is a shield, Disruption Break will
      be great to pair with it. If you don't use Disruption Break, you're better
      off using another Energy weapon with damage-increasing perks.
    rolls:
      - &t5shield
        name: (PvE) Super Picky Shieldbreaker

          That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and
          not many weapons can roll with that perk! We're adding ALH because
          to use Disruption Break you need to switch to your Kinetic weapon,
          which means ALH will proc and TJ5 will be reloaded and ready to go.
