      CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI).
      I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately
      we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls. Randy's is in the same slot and
      has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip already, so I'm not losing too much sleep about
      getting a perfect roll here.

          This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't
          increase stability but they would make this already great roll even
          better.
        barrels: [Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Rapid Hit]
        perks2: [Explosive Rounds, Vorpal]

    summary: >
      This is the only Scout Rifle that can roll Vorpal or Osmosis however there
      are no damage perks, unless you consider Vorpal a damage perk. This is a
      low priority hence the "Future-proofing" rolls here.
    rolls:
      - &pfuture
        name: (PvE) Future-proofing, Rapidly
        desc: >
          We'll take any barrel that doesn't harm our weakest stats and any
          magazine that doesn't harm us as well.
        barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Rapid Hit]
