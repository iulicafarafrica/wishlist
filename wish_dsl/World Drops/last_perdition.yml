      A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like
      Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. Lots
      of resources for this one, including the [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/) [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns).
      I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and
      Mercules904 quite a bit in here.

      * KK: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil
      makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more
      Stability."

      * KK: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you
      feel recoil too much"

      * M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a
      medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"

      * M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a
      multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because
      it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo.
      If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can
      ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
      
      * CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier
      Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom
      scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while
      ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more
      sluggish. Zen Moment is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is
      super high at 66.


      For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition!
      Here he is on PC - 
      ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) -
      and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the 
      Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning
      with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like
      being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."

          This will be our generally acceptable classic set of Pulse Rifle rolls.

          With `Moving Target` and `Zen Moment`, your weapon should only produce
          yellow numbers.
        barrels: [SPO-28 Front, SLO-10 Post, SPO-26 Front, SLO-12 Post, SLO-21 Post]

      - &lpabsurdlyplanted
        name: (PvP) Absurdly Planted
        desc: >
          A roll based around the criminally underrated `Firmly Planted`. This is
          a pure Slif roll; don't blame any one for it :) M904: "I'm really starting
          to appreciate Firmly Planted" - see! :)

    summary: >
      When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of
      the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool. It's basically an
      Energy-slot Bygones-equivalent, so the rolls will be similar. We're going
      for as much sustained damage output and as much range as we can get. The
      key difference(s) will be that SUROS weapons have scopes and a different
      set of magazine options. Yes these are a narrow set of rolls but there's
      so much competition for the Energy slot you need something spicy to make
      the cut.
      
      Some PvE rolls are mentioned above in the PvP set, because the perks
      overlap. I've labelled them PvP/PvE where appropriate.
    rolls:
      - &lppvemagdrop
        name: (PvE) Super Picky Mag Dropper
        desc: >
          Similar to the above set of rolls but we're rolling with Drop Mag here
          so we can shoot for other perks in the first column. Firmly Planted is
          totally usable in PvE and turns this in to a laser beam.
        barrels: [SPO-57 Front, SPO-28 Front, SLO-10 Post, SPO-26 Front, SLO-21 Post]
        magazines: [Drop Mag, Alloy Magazine]

          If you need a solid Pulse Rifle in your Energy slot, by all means this
          roll will do work. This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a
          standard DPS roll.
