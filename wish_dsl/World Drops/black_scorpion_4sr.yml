      [CoolGuy's BS4 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY)
      in August of 2019 is great source of info. It's using the original D2Y1 perk
      pool so what I'm suggesting here is likely not to be too much of a surprise.
      Since this is a wishlist for controller, the Recoil is `60`, demanding we use
      a Counterbalance mod to make even passable. Check out CoolGuy's video for a
      before/after (@6:40). On PC, sure, skip that but because of this, you're not
      going to see me recommend Rampage + Rampage Spec. Check out
      [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k)
      and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black
      Scorpion in action. Not gonna lie here... these rolls are *tough* to get,
      because you only get one crack at the perks in the final two columns.
    rolls:
      - 
        name: (PvP) 100 Recoil + Maxing Stability
        desc: >
          This is a Scout Rifle and there aren't many lanes on Crucible maps
          where you're going to see appreciable Range falloff *and* where
          you could also imagine holding a Rapid-Fire Full-Auto Scout Rifle steady
          enough to get hits. That means we're going for Recoil and Stability.
          Zen Moment gives you a bump to your *base* Stability which you can see
          [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability for
          the Black Scorpion is pretty darn high @ `54`. No Outlaw because the
          reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of.
          Throw a Counterbalance mod on here to hit `100` Recoil.
        barrels: [Arrowhead Brake]
        magazines: [Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Zen Moment]
        perks2: [Rangefinder]
        masterworks: [Stability MW]
      - 
        name: (PvP) Maxing Stability; Recoil 75
        desc: >
          Similar to the above, but we're choosing some of the better Stability
          granting barrels. Still requires you to install a Counterbalance mod.
        barrels: [Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore]
        magazines: [Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Zen Moment]
        perks2: [Rangefinder]
        masterworks: [Stability MW]      
      - 
        name: (PvP) Mixing Range/Stability; Recoil 75
        desc: >
          Similar to the above, but we're relaxing constraints to include a mix of
          Range and Stability. Here we're adding Moving Target which gives you +5
          Aim Assist and +20 Mobility. I'm not includin Arrowhead Brake here
          because it's not helping us with Range or Stability.
        barrels: [Chambered Compensator, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore]
        magazines: [Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Zen Moment, Moving Target]
        perks2: [Rangefinder]
        masterworks: [Stability MW, Range MW]
      - 
        name: (PvP) Baseline (Range/Stability Mix)
        desc: >
          Similar to the above, but we're dropping the two hardest to get columns
          from the mix. The other columns are pretty do-able.
        barrels: [Chambered Compensator, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore]
        magazines: [Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: []
        perks2: []
        masterworks: [Stability MW, Range MW]

      What, no PvE rolls?! Nope. Being rapid-fire/low impact and having none of
      the spicy new damage perks (Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler, Vorpal, etc.) it's
      really not worth taking in to PvE. It's also perked weirdly, with Outlaw and
      Rampage being in the same slot, among others. There are so many amazing
      Energy weapons for PvE, it's hard to imagine this ever being top of your
      list. Go enjoy farming something else :)
