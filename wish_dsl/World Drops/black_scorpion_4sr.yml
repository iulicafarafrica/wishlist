    summary: >
      [CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY)
      is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive 
      Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns).
      There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to
      six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92
      extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be
      super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along
      the way.

      * Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a
      slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a
      [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
      
      * All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because
      "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."

      * The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find
      often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range,
      but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows
      through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a
      heck of a lot of Stability."
      
      * Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives
      you a bump to your base Stability which you can see
      [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a
      terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
      
      * No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS
      perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not
      make-or-break.


      Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and
      [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black
      Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the
      Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).

          Let's call this the "Mercules" roll, since listening
          to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all
          day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`.
          Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance
          of this roll is... slim.

          We get Stability from our Barrel, Magazine and optionally Zen Moment;
          can afford to lose out on Stability MW.

          The surrounding perks are so good that we'd take a roll without
          Rampage!

          In spite of not having any fourth column perk or a Stability
          Masterwork, this thing is still super, super stable.

          phenomenal roll here.
