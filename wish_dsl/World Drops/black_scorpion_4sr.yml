      [CoolGuy's BS4 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY)
      in August of 2019 is great source of info. It's using the original D2Y1 perk
      pool so what I'm suggesting here is likely not to be too much of a surprise.
      Since this is a wishlist for controller, the Recoil is `60`, demanding we use
      a Counterbalance mod to make even passable. Check out CoolGuy's video for a
      before/after (@6:40). Because of this, you're not going to see me recommend
      Rampage + Rampage Spec. Check out
      [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k)
      and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black
      Scorpion in action. Not gonna lie here... these rolls are *tough* to get,
      because you only get one crack at the perks in the final two columns.
    rolls:
      - &maxrecoil
        name: (PvP) 100 Recoil + Maxing Stability
        desc: >
          Zen Moment gives you a bump to your *base* Stability which you can see
          [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability for
          the Black Scorpion is pretty darn high @ `54`. No Outlaw because the
          reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of.
          Throw a Counterbalance mod on here to hit `100` Recoil. I want to call
          this roll out as special because of the 100 Recoil via Arrowhead,
          versus just including it as part of the following roll :)
        barrels: [Arrowhead Brake]
        magazines: [Steady Rounds, Accurized Rounds]
        perks1: [Zen Moment]
        perks2: [Rangefinder]
        masterworks: [Stability MW]

      What, no PvE rolls?! Nope. Being rapid-fire/low impact and having none of
      the spicy new damage perks (Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler, Vorpal, etc.) it's
      really not worth taking in to PvE. It's also perked weirdly, with Outlaw and
      Rampage being in the same slot, among others. There are so many amazing
      Energy weapons for PvE, it's hard to imagine this ever being top of your
      list. Go enjoy farming something else :)
