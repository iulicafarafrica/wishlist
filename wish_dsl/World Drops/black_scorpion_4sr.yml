      [CoolGuy's BS4 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY)
      in August of 2019 is great source of info. It's using the original D2Y1
      perk pool so what I'm suggesting here is likely not to be too much of a
      surprise. Unfortunately there are *seven* perks in the final two columns
      making them a beast to lock down; these rolls will be tough to get. Recoil
      is `60`, demanding we use a Counterbalance mod. Check out CoolGuy's video
      for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
      Because of this, you're not going to see me recommend Rampage + Rampage
      Spec.
      Range-wise, the base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going
      to find often on a PvP map, so we're kind of OK with it. Because it's full
      auto, we're going to be focused on Stability. Zen Moment gives you a bump
      to your *base* Stability which you can see
      [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability for
      the Black Scorpion is pretty darn high @ `54`. No Outlaw because the
      reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of.

      Scorpion in action.

          As much Stability however we can get it. You have almost no chance at
          getting this to drop :)

          It's super hard to get perks in the final two columns, and without
          those perks we've still got a phenomenal roll.

      What, no PvE rolls?! Nope. Being rapid-fire/low impact and having none of
      the spicy new damage perks (Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler, Vorpal, etc.) it's
      really not worth taking in to PvE. It's also perked weirdly, with Outlaw and
      Rampage being in the same slot, among others. There are so many amazing
      Energy weapons for PvE, it's hard to imagine this ever being top of your
      list. Go enjoy farming something else :)
