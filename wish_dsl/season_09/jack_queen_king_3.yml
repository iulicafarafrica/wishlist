  summary: >
    This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming
    City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons apart from
    Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the
    best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u).
    `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling are nuts! For analysis and gameplay, check out
    this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One
    interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and
    medium range one is about half a meter" so I'm not going to value a
    combination of Range perks highly here. The Handling is phenomenal, so I'm
    not going to value Snapshot super highly either.

        Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get 
        this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much
        Stability as we can get.

        Let's see how much damage we can do in PvP with a Dragonfly Spec mod
        on this weird roll.

        Listen, the base stats are so good that if we toss out the hardest to
        get perk columns, we still have something pretty amazing.

        Even without much greatness in the core perk columns, with the other
        columns on some solid perks, this thing will do work.

    "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and
    probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so
    we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and 
    Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're
    probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective
    range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns.

        Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly
        explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't
        forget Dragonfly Spec!

        You'll almost never have to reload here, because getting kills with the
        sustained DPS perks will give you your grenade back and using your
        grenace will reload the magazine.
