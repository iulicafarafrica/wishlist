    CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI).
    I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately
    we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls. Randy's is in the same slot and
    has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip already, so I'm not losing too much sleep about
    getting a perfect roll here.

        This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't
        increase stability but they would make this already great roll even
        better.

    This is the only Scout Rifle that can roll Vorpal or Osmosis. This isn't a
    high priority roll for you to go after and it's also pretty much the core
    components of the PvP rolls we have down already. With the S92 double-perk
    bonus, you should be able to get one of these pretty promptly :)
