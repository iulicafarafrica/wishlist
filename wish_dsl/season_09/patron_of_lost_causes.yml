    CoolGuy [goes ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI) on PoLC. I'm
    on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately
    we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls as we're looking for. Randy's has
    Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip, so this is a pretty low priority farm (and also why it's
    so specific).
  rolls:
    - 
      name: PvP - "Super Picky"
      barrels: [Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel]
      magazines: [Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell]
      perks1: [Rapid Hit]
      perks2: [Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal]
      masterworks: [Stability MW]

    CoolGuy [goes ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI) on PoLC. For
    PvE, it's the only scout (as of now) that can roll Vorpal and Osmosis. Not a
    super high priority for PvE and not a terribly hard set of perks to farm.
