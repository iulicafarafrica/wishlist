  summary: >
    For PvE, [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) likes
    Demolitionist with Swashbuckler or Rampage for a large damage boost.

    Trench barrel has been nerfed to the point where there are better options
    but it could be worth picking one up in case the perk gets revived.

    There are also better One-Two Punch shotguns, but it wouldn't be a bad
    secondary perk if you're at s92.

    For PvP, he likes Slideshot with Opening Shot or Rampage and 
    [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA2gxu6OIUI) agrees
    with him.
