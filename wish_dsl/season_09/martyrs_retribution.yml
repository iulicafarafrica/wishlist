    summary: >
      I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype!
      Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want
      this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for
      velocity, reload and handling wherever I can get it. The base Velocity is `76`
      and since the second column perks are fixed, that's a flat `+9` so we're at `84`.
      That seems more than good enough, so lets focus on reload + handling.
      There's only one roll here because it's not that hard to farm.

          Threat Detector has such a long proc range that I'm going to put it on
          par with Auto-Loading Holster here. We can choose (or not choose) to use
          the reload and handling boosts on Elemental Capacitor, paired with the
          masterworks. Don't forget a `Quick Access Sling` mod!

          Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor which is the hardest to get out
          of the other perks.

      This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll
      is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.

          We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this
          roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly?

          Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this
          will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade
          rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon
          and so on...
