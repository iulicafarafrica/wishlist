    This is for use from range, and Blast Radius doesn't do anything on Wave
    Frame launchers - simple wishlist here :) Why not demolitionist? You're not
    going to get final blows with this so much in PvP and with ALH, it will
    always be loaded. I'd rather have better handling or reload with Elemental
    Capacitor always-on.

    This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll
    is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go. Threat
    Detector might seem odd, but it increases reload speed and because this GL
    doesn't do any impact damage, it will have great reload up close.
