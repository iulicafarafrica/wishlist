  summary: >
    Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4)
    on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players".
    It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a
    Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I
    prefer the unaltered charge time.

  summary: >
    CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant.
    It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO,
    on this particular weapon).
