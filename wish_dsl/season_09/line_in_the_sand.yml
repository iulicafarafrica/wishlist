  summary: >
    Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons
    [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we
    approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice,
    but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what
    will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you
    an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
