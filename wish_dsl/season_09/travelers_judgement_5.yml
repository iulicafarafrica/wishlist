    CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)!
    Paraphrased: There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can
    roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (Slif: ?!). Rapid Hit and Tap
    the Trigger being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few
    of these. Keep in mind they don't benefit from from the Season Pass L92 
    additional perk in the last slot, so it can be a bit painful. Recently,
    True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08)
    and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls. I've
    included all but the worst two sights that majorly ding Stability and
    Handling.

        Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and TtT procs on every other burst.
        Going for max range after that. This is going to be an incredibly hard
        roll to get, so buy a lottery ticket if it lands for you.

        Same as above, with all but the worst sights allowed. This is an
        absolutely phenomenal roll and also pretty darn hard to get.

        Disruption Break works in PvP apparently!? Same set of rolls as above,
        but pairing with Disruption Break instead of Tap the Trigger.

        Don't Sleep on Disruption Break! CoolGuy makes a great point: we might
        see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks can be applied to
        sidearms. That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and
        not many weapons can roll with that perk!
