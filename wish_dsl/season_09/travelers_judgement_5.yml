    CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)!
    Paraphrased: There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can
    roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (Slif: ?!). Rapid Hit and Tap
    the Trigger being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few
    of these. Keep in mind they don't benefit from from the S92 benefit of an
    additional perk in the last slot, so it can be a bit painful.

      name: (PvP) Picky Tapping

        Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and Tap procs on every other burst.
        Going for max range after that.

        Disruption Break works in PvP apparently!? Same set of rolls as above,
        but pairing with Disruption Break instead of Tap the Trigger.

        Don't Sleep on Disruption Break! CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where
        artifact perks can be applied to sidearm. That could mean breaking
        Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that
        perk!
