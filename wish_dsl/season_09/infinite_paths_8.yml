    CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls
    originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames
    [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&feature=youtu.be&t=1023)
    and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse
    Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward
    you with the second slowest TTK.

      name: (PvP) Picky
      desc: >
        This roll focuses on addressing recoil and stability. Because it needs
        so much help, there isn't much room left for neat damage perks :)
      barrels: [Chambered Compensator]
      magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
      perks1: [Moving Target]
      perks2: [Zen Moment]

        Useful for those subclasses with ranged melees. This is a fringe roll,
        one that I wouldn't throw away but not one that I'm racing to collect.

      magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
      perks1: [Moving Target]

    Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE)
    mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a
    fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these
    while they're still available?

      name: (PvE) Explosive Dragon
      desc: >
        This is the only weapon in the game that has this perk combo available!
        Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will
        count as an additional kill for Demolitionist. It does work. Probably
        not your best Energy weapon but a fun one for shredding red bars. I
        would collect it and store it.

        Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your
        Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. ðŸ‘ŠPUNCH AWAY!ðŸ‘Š
