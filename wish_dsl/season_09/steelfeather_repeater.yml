    CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI)
    of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base
    Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to
    correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base
    Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control
    unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out,
    we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil
    mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small
    number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so
    amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for
    PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689)
    for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything
    beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

        We're looking to max stability after maxing recoil, as much as we can.
        The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other
        sources of stability are terrific of course, but without those two, we
        don't have enough control to matter.

    There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a
    [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the
    weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4)
    has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly
    they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its
    applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In
    Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs
    better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally
    don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

        How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range
        and Stability as possible?

        With artifacts all over the map, it's possible we get another Barrier mod
        that applies to Auto Rifles. This could be a fun one to bank.
