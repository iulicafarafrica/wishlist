  summary: >
    CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI)
    of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base
    Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to
    correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base
    Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control
    unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out,
    we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil
    mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small
    number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so
    amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for
    PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689)
    for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything
    beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

    There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a
    [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the
    weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4)
    has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly
    they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its
    applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In
    Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs
    better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally
    don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
