    CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE
    and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls
    while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is
    more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision.
    More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability
    because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to
    agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times.
    Without Vorpal or Quickdraw, it's just another two-burst sidearm, which is great
    but you don't need a wishlist for that :)

        This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer
        range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through
        supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
      barrels: [Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel]
      magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
      perks1: [Threat Detector]
      perks2: [Vorpal]
      masterworks: [Range MW]

        Any roll in this set would give you an A+ PvP roll. Without Vorpal or
        Quickdraw in the final column, you're better off using a Smuggler's Word
        with Tap the Trigger.
      barrels: [Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel]
      magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
      perks1: [Threat Detector, Demolitionist, Outlaw]
      perks2: [Vorpal, Quickdraw]
      masterworks: [Range MW]

      name: (PvP) Super Picky (Minus MW and Accurized)
      desc: >
        Same as before, minus the Range MW and Accurized Rounds since you have
        only a 25% to get each of them. This is still an amazing roll.

        You've got basically a 50% chance of getting this roll :) Yes it would
        be awesome to have +20 range from Accurized and a Range MW but it's still
        a great weapon.
