  summary: >
    More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for
    a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the Beloved
    (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City).

    Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon.

         Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's
         only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable
         to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse
         Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it
         doesn't feel so sluggish.  I don't know that this makes it some kind
         of S-Tier sniper but why not give it a shot? Sniping is so personal.

        Relaxing our available selection of barrels to all but the few that
        hinder the already low Handling. Also dropping a Magazine requirement
        because none of them are so harmful as to tank the roll or helpful as
        to propel it.

    CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI)
    "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated).
    Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance.
    You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are
    so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this
    sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo
    of the barrel perk and Masterwork.

        That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here
        to be able to do that.

        Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it
        with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then
        switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.

        Heavyweight modifier? Never run out of ammo. Famine modifier? That rare
        Heavy brick is like finding a Special brick at the same time.
