    summary: >
      Talons of the Eagle is a 150 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Scout Rifle.
      It originally appeared wayyy back in Season 4 (aka Forsaken). It's been
      recently re-issued in the first Season 11 Iron Banner. As part of this
      re-issue, the perk pool is unchanged, so we have years' worth of knowledge
      about how these work and years' worth of confusion as to why Scout Rifles
      can roll with `Threat Detector` and `Hip-Fire Grip`.

      
      The general drawback of 150s is their low `Stability` and `Handling` so
      we're going to address those in our rolls.

          `Firmly Planted` is your best bet here. It's terrific on long-range
          weapons like Pulse Rifles and Scouts where you can post up in
          relative cover and ping foes from a distance. There's also not much
          else terrific in that slot. Zen Moment is good, but Firmly Planted
          outclasses it.

      As mentioned in the PvP summary, Talons is still rocking that Season 4
      perk pool, meaning we're back to our tried-and-true combinations.

          `Outlaw` + `Rampage`, same as it ever was! Going for the classic DPS
          combo with as much `Range` as we can get.
