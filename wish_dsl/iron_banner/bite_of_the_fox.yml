    summary: >
      Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It's been in
      the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season
      11. This means if you *had* a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season,
      so you'll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.


      Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super
      in the Crucible. Every super has a different damage-resistance tier that
      affects your ability to do that however Aggressive Frames do not care
      about such things.


      The perk pool is unchanged in the re-issue, so we have a pretty simple
      set of rolls we're chasing.
      
      
      With respect to PvE below, there's no Triple-
      Tap, Fourth Time's the Charm, Vorpal, etc. so I'd suggest you use
      something else in PvE in the Kinetic slot. If you absolutely had to have
      one, maybe [`Firmly Planted` + `Field Prep`]?

          If you like to drag snipe 
          [like I do](https://twitter.com/CrucibleFootage/status/1266915926240227330)
          then this `Moving Target` roll is going to be for you. We're looking
          for as much `Range` and `Handling` as we can get. What a lot of people
          don't notice about the `Moving Target` perk description is that its
          benefits are conferred occur only **while moving**. We take this for
          granted in PvP ("of course I'm not going to be standing still") but 
          depending on your sniper playstyle, you might or might not be.
