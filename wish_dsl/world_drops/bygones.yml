  summary: >
    You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because,
    well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance
    mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference.
    Why Bygones? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other
    randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If
    this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault!
    Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls: (1) Strongly consider
    using a single +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get
    the Recoil to 94 which is basically straight up and down. Arrowhead Brake will
    let us do this without a mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range
    benefits of those other barrels (2) Handling is solid, among the highest
    of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this (3)
    With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that
    Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide
    completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range,
    precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off
    before Slideshot dissipates. If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do
    work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE).
    He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW. I am requiring Kill Clip
    because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing
    makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great
    follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.

      desc: >
        Going for maximum Stability here; at least a little bit in every column.
        If you get this roll, buy both of us a lottery ticket. "But Slif, Range
        improves accuracy and damage falloff" Check out the ZkMushroom video
        above and tell me if you think the lack of Range-boosting perks
        handicaps Bygones here.

        This is really just for grins. I haven't played with it myself but check
        out [Cammy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBfOa69GjGU) for
        more. The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it,
        so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will
        absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

  summary: >
    The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn
    burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal. Why farm for one?
    Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly
    rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype
    gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault. We're going for
    sustained DPS and maximum range falloff. Stability is already high enough
    and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control
    recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks
    too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage
    Spec mod on it!

        Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls,
        as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.

        This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a standard DPS roll.
        Without perks in both of these columns, there's not a strong reason
        to run this in PvE. If this is all you end up getting, fine to hang
        on to it and hope for an archetype buff at some point.
