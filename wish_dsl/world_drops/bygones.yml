      You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because,
      well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance
      mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's
      video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Just
      recently CoolGuy 
      [updated his prior review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMBASjJDwQ)
      of Bygones and those thoughts
      have been incorporated in to the rolls below.


      Why bother with Bygones in 2020? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other
      randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If
      this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault!


      Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls:
      

      * Consider
      using a +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get
      the Recoil to 94 which is nearly vertical with a slightly left pull. Arrowhead Brake will
      get us to 99 Recoile without a CB mod but you're sacrificing the
      stability and range benefits of those other barrels. That being said, it
      would free up your mod slot for something like Targeting Adjuster or
      Rampage Spec.
      
      * Handling is solid, among the highest
      of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this.

      * With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that
      Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide
      completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range,
      precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off
      before Slideshot dissipates.
      
      * I am requiring Kill Clip
      because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing
      makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great
      follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.

          CoolGuy: "This is a safe bet. It's a roll you'll be able to pull out
          a year from now and do well with." Arrowhead Brake means your recoil
          is at 99 and you can skip the Countbalance mod.

          From CoolGuy's video above, it turns out that Headseeker is applied on
          top of Kill Clip's damage. This is kind of intense.

          This is really just for grins. I haven't played with it myself but check
          out [Cammy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBfOa69GjGU) for
          more (it's also mentioned in CoolGuy's video, referencing Cammy).
          The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it,
          so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will
          absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

    summary: >
      The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn
      burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal.
      
      
      Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the
      only other randomly
      rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype
      gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault.
      
      We're going for
      sustained DPS and maximum range. Stability is already high enough
      and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control
      recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks
      too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage
      Spec mod on it!

          This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a standard DPS roll.
