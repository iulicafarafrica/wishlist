      If you're a member of the [Fighting Lion Club](https://www.fightinglion.club/)
      are looking for a replacement once your Mountaintop can no longer be infused,
      give Truthteller a try.


      Truthteller is part of the "Lightweight Frame" breach-loaded (single shot)
      grenade launchers.  Lightweight grenade launchers all have a "remote detonation"
      ability where they detonate when you release the trigger (or you get a
      direct hit). These weapons have a very high skill ceiling, allowing banked shots
      and shots that explode next to enemies in cover.


      In PvP, this weapon excels at starting engagements rather than finishing them.
      We want Truthteller to soften our enemies up, even if we don't get a direct hit.


      There are a couple of perks that help us meet this goal:

      - Auto Loading Holster - be ready for that next engagement with a fully loaded weapon

      - Disruption Break - breaking an opponents shield gives kinetic weapons a 50% buff.
         Quick swapping to a kinetic primary ammo weapon will allow for quick cleanup (likely
         a one-shot/one-burst)


      I'll be pairing this with the `Quick Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with every shot
      and let us more quickly clean up what we've started.

    summary: >
      In PvE there are a couple of roles that Truthteller can fill, and a number of
      great perks to look for.


      Blinding grenades have a 10 meter radius on a 5 second suppression effect which
      works on all non-Boss creatures.  In high-level PvE content, this can be really
      useful for suppressing a large area and having an entire fireteam do damage
      without worrying about retaliation.


      As of Season 11, it feels like there's some sort of bug or issue with Concussion
      Grenades.  They have the same -50 penalty to blast radius of Blinding Grenades and
      also have the same 5s duration to the effect, but their area of effect is only a
      5 meter radius (~25% of the total area impacted).


      Spike Grenades can also be good if you're looking to do direct damage.  Truthteller
      isn't quite at Mountaintop levels of damage, but it's probably the best thing
      we have as a replacement.   In testing, Mountaintop with Spike Grenades does 21,048
      damage.  Truthteller with Spike Grenades does 15,185, so about 28% less.


      Auto-loading Holster is the best 3rd column perk for almost every situation, the
      only possible exception is using Field Prep and crouching for faster reload if
      you're looking to spam this weapon.


      Normally, damage boosting perks like Swashbuckler and Multi-Kill clip are highly
      sought after on weapons, but for this archetype, it's fairly hard to keep those
      chains going enough to make them worth their while.


      Demolitionist is the best 4th column PvE pick as it has the dual effect of increasing
      the number of grenades you get, and filling the chamber with a shell after
      throwing a grenade.


      Disruption Break is also viable and for some situations would be amazing to help
      bring a blinded tough enemy down (now if Bungie would ever allow grenade launchers
      to have an Anti-Barrier mod, this would be _amazing_).
