    summary: >
      Gnawing Hunger is a 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Energy Auto Rifle first
      introduced in Season 6. It has been reissued in Season 11, meaning it will
      be capable of going up to the Season 14 power level cap. Adaptives were
      buffed Season 10 and unless something changes, will remain very strong
      through Season 11.


      For grins,

      using the generally agreed-upon "God roll" roll with `Tap the Trigger`,
      `Kill Clip` and a Stability Masterwork.

      > "Is there a bug with this gun or is it just really good? I feel like I'm killing too fast right now... like a little bit too fast. I don't get it."


      > "This... it feels better than Summoner and SUROS. I can't believe there's a weapon like this in the game and I didn't know about it. I've never seen something like this."


      > "Dude what is this TTK? I don't get it! This TTK is a little too fast Bungie."

      
      I hopped in to the Tribute Hall and ran several Recoil pattern tests
      with various Barrels, Magazines, Perks and Masterworks (Arrowhead, Steady
      Rounds, Tap the Trigger, etc.). At base Stability and Recoil (on console
      at least), it's pretty hard to control.
      
      
      There are two ways to get Gnawing Hunger to hone in for you:
      
      1. **Tap the Trigger**: The most noticeable difference in bullet
      concentration comes from TtT. If you want a laser beam, you want TtT. That
      being said, if you *only* get TtT and no other Stability or Recoil perks,
      it's not nearly as easy to control as it could be.

      2. **Arrowhead + Counterbalance**: This combo *absolutely works* as well.
      I was
      able to cluster rounds around small targets just fine, without TtT. If
      you don't get Zen Moment or Tap the Trigger in the third column, but you
      do get Arrowhead Brake in the first column, you might find it totally
      capable, especially if you're on PC.
      

      What you **really** want is to slam all these perks together for maximum
      Stability and minimal Recoil, and that's what we're going to break down
      below.

          With a Counterbalance mod, this roll will be `Recoil:99` and once you
          apply the Masterwork, `Stability:71`. Layered on top of `Tap the
          Trigger`, it's a thing of beauty.

          This will be a similar set of rolls to the above, but with pretty

          If you don't get `Tap the Trigger` or `Zen Moment`, you can still
          make this work with `Arrowhead Brake` and a Counterbalance mod. That
          will push your `Recoil` to `99` and then you're looking for at least
          one other material source of `Stability`.

      The best PvE roll of Gnawing Hunger is the curated one, and the only way
      to get it (as of Season 11) is via grinding T3 Reckoning.

      If that's off the table, then classic combos will carry the day here -
      reload perks combined with damage boosting perks, and as much Range as we
      can get.
