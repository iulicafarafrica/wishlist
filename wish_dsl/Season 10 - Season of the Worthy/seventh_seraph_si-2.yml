      The SI-2 is the 2020 version of the Anonymous Autumn (Kyt: *"which is the
      best-in-class for lightweight sidearms"*) and is the only other randomly
      rolled 360 RPM Energy sidearm. Mercules is on the same page: *"It (SI-2)
      doesn't have great Stability or great Range. I would pick a well-rolled
      Anonymous Autumn over this every time."* Why do they say that? It's got
      basically the same stats as an Anonymous Autumn but has 33% less Range
      and 20% less Stability. On the plus side the SI-2 has 7% better Handling
      (64 > 69) 🙃
      

      Even TrueVanguard, who absolutely loves the Anonymous Autumn (with over
      14,000 kills) depicts the SI-2 as situational, relying primarily on Vorpal
      to justify using it. Check out
      [his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCtP2PjAEgY).

      
      If you are going to consider the SI-2 for PvP, a few things to keep in
      mind:

      * The recoil direction is 95, so no need to worry about straightening it
      out. I.e. the +Recoil barrels shouldn't be your first pick. Instead,
      focus on Range and Stability.
      
      * Full Auto is going to be a make-or-break perk for some, as many guardians
      have a love-it-or-hate-it relationsihp with single-shot sidearms. If that's
      your thing, know that no other perk in that column is a must-have. I
      find that 360s are unsuable for me without it, so I'll be picking one of
      these up to see how it plays with Vorpal. 


      On to the rolls!

          Vorpal is really the key here. Without Vorpal, you're better off using
          the better-rolled Anonymous Autumn as mentioned above. Otherwise we're
          going for +Range and +Stability wherever we can get it.

          The presence or lack of the right masterwork isn't a deal-breaker.

      Like all other Seraph weapons, the SI-2 contributes to the generation
      of Warmind cells in PvE. If that's not your thing, you can pretty much
      pass on this weapon full stop. It could have made beautiful,
      beautiful music with the `Wrath of Rasputin` Warmind mod: `Solar splash
      damage final blows have a chance to create Warmind Cells`. Unfortunately
      the SI-2 is a Void weapon 👿

      
      That being said, there are a few combos that could prove interesting for
      the discerning collector / sidearm aficionado.

          The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both
          Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist
          counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade
          back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod from Ada-1!

          Sidearms are all the rage in the Season 10 Artifact, and certainly
          will be again at some point in the future. If you want to dump
          rounds in to Champions, you don't have any other options in this
          slot.

          Like Grave Robber and Swashbuckler, these two perks play super well
          off each other. If you love sidearms, considering adding this to your
          collection. You'll do some serious damage during Seraph Tower events.
