      The VY-7 is a 600 RPM Energy "Precision Frame" SMG. Here's how it compares
      to all other randomly-rolled 600 RPM SMGs on
      [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=trStZ;CYr9QP;CQZu7f;B9hF8b;).
      It's competitive base-stat-wise but there's a reason you've probably never
      been killed by any of these weapons (or any SMG for that matter) since the
      first year of Destiny 2. In Season 10 with the recent Adaptive Auto Rifle
      buff, Auto Rifles outclass SMGs and failing ARs, both sidearms and
      shotguns are going to frustrate the hell out of you.


      Forget it right? But do you remember this world?

      If you didn't bother clicking the comparison link above, I'll spoil it
      for you. The VY-7 is an Energy Antiope-D (the basic stat variances are
      immaterial in practice). Yes it's not the meta now, but a solid roll might
      be worth throwing in the vault.
      
      
      The difference between `59` (base) and `80` Range buys you about a
      whopping one meter of falloff (~16 to ~17m). Given the base Range is
      already so high, I'm going to suggest maximizing Stability. You'll notice
      that I don't feature a `Vorpal` roll here. I'm
      a huge fan of `Vorpal` in PvP, but given this is such a short range weapon
      and it's a Scatter shot, I think gunning down a super with an SMG would be
      a tall order :)

          We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so
          we can go for Range surrounding our pick of the criminially underrated
          Firmly Planted, which turns this in to an absolute laser. What the
          hell is `Elemental Capacitor` doing in there?! The Stability and
          Handling boosts are tremendous; you absolutely feel them.

    summary: >
      The VY-7 is the only SMG that's able to roll with Vorpal and you'll want
      one of these for two reasons:

      
      * The VY-7 is a Seraph weapon and contributes to the generation of Warmind
      Cells.

      * SMGs are eligible for certain Season 10 Artifact weapon mods.
      

      ...so let's come up with some rolls that help shred Champions and generate
      Warmind Cells (i.e. shred adds).
      

      You must absolutely run a `Counterbalance` Mod or otherwise
      fix the Recoil with `Arrowhead Brake` or `Chambered Compensator`. Even
      though its base Recoil is `91` it's still a hot mess to control, esp.
      with its low Handling. For the rolls below I'm going to assume you're
      rolling with a `Counterbalance` Mod installed.

          Whenever SMGs are up on the Artifact, you'll want Vorpal to help shred
          through Champions. FTTC might seem like a strange choice for an SMG
          but the rate of fire is so fast, you'd be surprised how often it you
          end up getting it to proc. I won't be relaxing either Vorpal or FTTC
          on these rolls because just one of either would mean that it's not
          worth using this over something else in the Energy slot.
