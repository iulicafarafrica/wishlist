      The VY-7 is a 600 RPM Energy "Precision Frame" SMG. Here's how it compares
      to all other randomly-rolled 600 RPM SMGs on
      [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=trStZ;CYr9QP;CQZu7f;B9hF8b;).
      It's competitive base-stat-wise but there's a reason you've probably never
      been killed by any of these weapons (or any SMG for that matter) since the
      first year of Destiny 2. In Season 10 with the recent Adaptive Auto Rifle
      buff, Auto Rifles outclass SMGs and failing ARs, both sidearms and
      shotguns are going to frustrate the hell out of you.


      Forget it right? But do you remember this world?

      If you didn't bother clicking the comparison link above, I'll spoil it
      for you. The VY-7 is basically the same weapon as the Antiope. SMGs
      themselves haven't changed - the meta around them has. I think you'll want
      to put one of these in your vault and hold out for a buff. Now granted,
      they don't have the stability- and accuracy-increasing perk pool that
      Antiope did, but it does have very different barrels and magazines that
      can push the Range and Stability just as high. Worth a hold of at least one
      good roll!

          We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so
          we can go for Range surrounding our pick of the criminially underrated
          Firmly Planted, which turns this in to an absolute laser. Fully
          Masterworked, these rolls would net out to 80-91 Range, being slightly
          lower and slightly higher than the Antiope at either end of the
          spectrum.

          We're going to get so much stability and accuracy from Firmly Planted
          that we can be pretty loose in our other requirements.

    summary: >
      The VY-7 is the only SMG that's able to roll with Vorpal and you'll want
      one of these for two reasons:

      
      * The VY-7 is a Seraph weapon and contributes to the generation of Warmind
      Cells.

      * SMGs are eligible for certain Season 10 Artifact weapon mods.
      

      There aren't any obvious pairings and I think that's to Bungie's credit.
      We're not here talking about the same old Outlaw + Kill
      Clip or Grave Robber + Swashbuckler snoozefest. I think a lot of the same
      things that make this interesting in PvP contribute to interesting PvE
      rolls as well.


      **Third Column**: `Firmly Planted` makes a dramatic difference in
      stability. In PvE you can crouch to your heart's content. Of course this
      is far from required if all you're doing is generating Warmind cells but
      it is pretty amazing :)


      **Fourth Column**: Why aren't I selecting Dragonfly? Given the RPM, the
      chance you finish with a precision bullet seems quite low. I'd rather the
      always-on benefits of `Feeding Frenzy` or `Vorpal`.

        desc: >
          Vorpal procs against Champions and any season where SMGs can take
          Artifact mods (Season 10 for example!) this is a solid pull.

          Using Steady Rounds, we can drop the requirement for Firmly Planted.
          Sure it's not exactly the same, but we're not talking super high-end
          requirements here :)

          We'll take Extended Barrel but only if we can also get Feeding Frenzy.
