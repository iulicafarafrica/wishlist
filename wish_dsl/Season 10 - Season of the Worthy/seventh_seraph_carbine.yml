      [Carbine compared to other randomly-rolled 450 RPM Autos](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;Bqp0Wx;mJ1-6)


      In Season 10, 450 RPM Precision Frame Auto Rifles like the Carbine
      aren't part of the PvP meta. It does have a best-in-class base Recoil of
      `74` meaning you can safely choose other barrels than Arrowhead Brake or
      Chambered Compensator (although Chambered is still fine!). It's also the
      only Auto Rifle available now in the game that can roll Vorpal.


      Given the Carbine's super low Aim Assist, I suggest a `Targeting Adjuster`
      mod for all PvP rolls.

          Marcules isn't a fan of this in PvP, but there have been times where
          the meta has shifted as it did in S10 towards 600 RPM Adaptive Autos.
          There's certainly a chance 450s see a change in the future. If you
          happen across a high-stability roll, he suggests vaulting.

          We get Stability from our Barrels or Magazines; can afford to lose out
          on Stability MW. Reload and Handling Masterworks would be solid
          choices here too. You won't see too much benefit from Range, but it
          never hurts.

          Slideshot is a solid perk but if 450s become the meta again, it's not
          a perk you're going to miss on an otherwise solid roll.

          Shredding supers in 6s is, we can all agree, Destiny's National
          Pastime. Here you'll find the Mercule's suggested roll reprised with
          Vorpal in the final column.

    name: PvE
    summary: >
      For its **base stats and perks**, there isn't a whole lot of reason to consider
      the Carbine for PvE. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon, is also 450RPM
      and recently received a buff in Season 10. It positively shreds in PvE and
      since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10 Artifact mods.
    

      "OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"

      1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the
      current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take Overload mods (and in the future
      will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods I'm sure).
      
      1. It's a Seraph weapon, and if you're running Warmind mods on your armor,
      Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.


      "Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the
      seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else ðŸ˜ƒ

          The core of this roll are the final two perk columns. Stil phenomenal
          sans HCR.

          Run-of-the-mill Auto-Rifle PvE slayer perk set here. If you like the
          look, feel and sound of the Carbine as I do, you'll do solid work with
          this roll in lower/middle tier PvE content (e.g. your daily bounty
          grinds).
