    summary: >
      The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic
      Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s,
      over on
      [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3).
      In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material
      deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist
      mod.

      
      Should you pick one up for use in Season 10? In Season 10, 600 RPM
      "Adaptive Frame" Auto Rifles are the meta (e.g. SUROS Regime, Monte Carlo,
      Hard Light). If you've stepped foot into any game mode in the Crucible,
      you've no doubt been a part of a Hard Light laser-light-show rave :) So
      no, there's no pressing reason if you're primarily a PvP player or if you
      already have the PvE roll you want, to keep chasing SSC rolls for PvP. Of
      course there's a chance 450s are buffed in later patches/seasons, so if
      you come across a decent roll, by all means throw it in the vault. I
      wouldn't suggest going out of your way to farm SSC bounties however.
      

      I played with a
      [zero-Recoil, high Stability](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/DY2Aqw8sOokyOvhv0Wv1Ehw9zBP2FwQRxW2Ig9KX1MIo3LEpW)
      roll for several Iron Banner games, with both Enhanced Targeting and
      Enhanced Unflinching... I immediately wanted to go back to using my Arc
      Logic with Moving Target and Tap the Trigger :) The SSC is definitely a
      bit slower than you'd prefer. That being said, if you're a fan of ARs or
      even just the SSC itself (it looks and sounds terrific IMHO!), here's a
      few rolls worth considering that you can put to work today.

          This is your workhorse Auto Rifle roll: vertical recoil and as much
          Stability and accuracy as you can get.

          Slideshot is active for two seconds starting from the slide, so you
          really only have about one second to put it to use. Without it, this
          is still a phenomenal roll.

          The `74` base Recoil is arguably just fine, so let's see if we can
          pick up a bit more Stability from our Barrels. Let's also bring in
          Flared for an additional Stability option on the Magazine.

          We get Stability from our Barrels or Magazines; can afford to lose out
          on Stability MW. Reload and Handling Masterworks would be solid
          choices here too. You won't see too much benefit from Range, but it
          never hurts.

    summary: >
      For its base stats and perks, there isn't a whole lot of reason to
      consider the SSC for PvE. While it does feature Swashbuckler and Rampage,
      it doesn't combine it with a reload-boosting perk like Feeding Frenzy or
      Outlaw. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon with the unique perk
      `Onslaught` is also 450 RPM and recently received a buff in Season 10. It
      shreds in PvE and since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10
      Artifact mods.

      Still, there's at least a couple of reasons why you might want to consider
      a SSC.

      1. It's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor,
      Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.

      1. It can roll with `Fourth Time's the Charm` and `Vorpal` together, which
      activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take
      Overload mods. In the future things will rotate back around to take
      Anti-Barrier too. The mag seems endless when dumping in to Champions and
      bosses; kinda cool :)

          This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE
          content. FTTC and Vorpal make the roll; without both you may as well
          use another Vorpal weapon. Based on the past two seasons, they won't
          be hard to come by :)

          Run-of-the-mill Auto-Rifle PvE slayer perk set here. If you like the
          look, feel and sound of the Carbine as I do, you'll do solid work with
          this roll.
