      [Officer Revolver compared to other randomly-rolled 180s](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C1DOIY;xtxS0;DzBRNi)


      **Mercules**: *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon except
      for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil. Statistically, not a
      super impressive hand cannon."*


      **Kyt**: *"The biggest thing it has going for is that Precisions
      may come back [Slif: he means into the meta]. Right now they're just not fast
      enough."*


      **Mercules**: *"The only way they come back is if they can 3-tap which gives
      them a 0.67 TTK. Right now they're in a fine spot for what they are. They
      are really forgiving so the TTK isn't super fast (2H2B)."*


      Sounds pretty awful right? Well hold up! it's basically a Service
      Revolver. The Officer's Revolver has Barrels instead of the Service
      Revoler's Sights and other perks. It's also super easy to farm. You've got
      a ton of Warmind Bits kicking around; may as well do something with them.
      It's not a ringing endorsement 🤷‍♂️

          Pushing Stability with our Barrels so we can go with Range elsewhere.
          Again, without Vorpal, there's no hook; hard to justify using this over
          any other Kinetic Hand Cannon.

      There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding
      that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding
      another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service
      Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't
      one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my
      preferred.


      "OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"

      1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the
      current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods
      (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods
      I'm sure).
      
      1. It's a Seraph weapon, and if you're running Warmind mods on your armor,
      Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.


      "Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the
      seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can
      also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I
      can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying
      "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉

          This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE
          content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns
          and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal
          isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics.

          If you like the look, feel and sound of the Officer's Revolver as I
          do, and you want a little variety in your Kinetics, this is a fine
          roll. You'll do solid work with in lower/middle tier PvE content (e.g.
          your daily bounty grinds, Vanguard Strike playlist).

          Similar to the above, but since we have Feeding Frenzy for fast
          reloads, we can relax our magazines.
