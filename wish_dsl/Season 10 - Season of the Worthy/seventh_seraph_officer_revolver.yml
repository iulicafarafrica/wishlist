      Mercules and Kyt [aren't super hot](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown#t=33:44)
      on the Officer's Revolver.

      
      > **Mercules:** *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon
      except for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil then the Officer's.
      Statistically, Officer's is not a super impressive hand cannon."*


      Contrast that with
      [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM),
      who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload
      worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously
      [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM)
      wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.

      > **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats
      especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes
      it special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not
      the best stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those
      stats available on a 180."*

      
      If you're more in the Mercules/Kyt camp, you're looking for the standard
      solid set of Range-prioritizing base stats. If that's the case, Officer's
      Revolver won't be a super exciting gun for you and I suggest you check out
      other hand cannons in this slot! (e.g. Spare Rations, Austringer, Dire
      Promise, Old Fashioned, ...)

          Drewsky: *"Prioritizing Range while giving the best oveall stat package
          possible."* On Precision Hand Cannons the accuracy cone doesn't bloom
          much and recovers quickly. Given that Stability would help us with
          that, and Stabilty is very good, we're going to focus on other
          perks. Wait what? Timed Payload?! You said other perks but wow...
          that's supposed to be positively horrible. It causes double the flinch
          and the explosion has no range falloff. "But it lowers your TTK!"
          On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload shouldn't delay TTK (Drewsky
          didn't have one on hand to verify the math) meaning you get the kill
          on the last bullet, not on the last 17 damage from Timed Payload.

          Same as the above, minus Firmly Planted which might not be to
          everyone's playstyle/preference and still leaves you with a
          super unique roll.

      There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding
      that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding
      another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service
      Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't
      one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my
      preferred.


      "OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"

      1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the
      current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods
      (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods
      I'm sure).
      
      1. It's a Seraph weapon, and if you're running Warmind mods on your armor,
      Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.


      "Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the
      seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can
      also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I
      can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying
      "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉

          This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE
          content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns
          and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal
          isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics.

          If you like the look, feel and sound of the Officer's Revolver as I
          do, and you want a little variety in your Kinetics, this is a fine
          roll. You'll do solid work with in lower/middle tier PvE content (e.g.
          your daily bounty grinds, Vanguard Strike playlist).

          Similar to the above, but since we have Feeding Frenzy for fast
          reloads, we can relax our magazines.
