    summary: >
      The only reason to run the SAW is that it contributes to Warmind Cell
      generation. It's Recoil at 41 might be the worst in all of Destiny.
      Mercules: *"It's recoil is more horizontal than vertical"*. That being
      said, it's stats and perks scream "Boss DPS" at which point it won't
      actually generate Warmind Cells since you need kills for that.


      Given how difficult it is to farm Warmind weapons due to the scarcity
      of Encrypted Warmind bits, you're better off picking up almost any other
      Warmind weapon than this.


      If you do want a Machine Gun for boss damage, grab Xenophage or farm the
      Black Armory for Hammerhead or Menagerie for Fixed Odds.
