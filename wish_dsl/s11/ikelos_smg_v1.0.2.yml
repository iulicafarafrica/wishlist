    summary: >
      The IKELOS SMG 1.0.2 is an Aggressive Frame, Energy-slot 750 RPM SMG.
      Back during the
      Warmind times (Season 3) its statically-rolled predecessor was a
      seriously legit part of the PvP meta. Apart from the original IKELOS SMG,
      in the history of Destiny 2, this archetype has had an unfortunate time
      of things. The only
      [other Aggressive Frames](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CEeZUk;BZzrdV;GStUF;)
      have punishingly, unusably poor `Stability` so they never saw any
      play, not even on the fringes of the meta.


      A few weeks into Season 11 an Bungie drops the new version of the IKELOS
      SMG, now called the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 (compared to S3's V1.0.1). It now
      features random rolls with the new Y3 perks like Vorpal Weapon and
      Demolitionist. It also has a tremendous amount of Stability compared to
      its brethren, about triple.


      * **`Seraph Rounds`**: The streamer~youtuberati are all abuzz about this
      perk. It has HCR built-in and does increased flinch! It increases
      Stability! It increases Range! One of those
      is correct - it does give a boost to damage falloff range. When I
      tested `Seraph Rounds` in the Tribute Hall, it pushed the range out by
      ~1m. Yep, a whole one meter. When I swapped in Accurized Rounds, it was
      basically the same, with a difference of less than a meter. I wouldn't 
      lose sleep about missing out on `Seraph Rounds`. Since this is a console
      wishlist and these Aggressive Frame SMGs have huge kick, we're going to
      prefer `Steady Rounds` and the attendant 38% increase in `Stability`.
      
      * **`Threat Detector`**: The only evidence I've been able to find of how
      this perk works is present in this video:
      ["Threat Detector In Depth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7Fgvgchq8)
      which deduces a massive +20 to Stability at TDx1. The range for TDx1 is
      14.8M (and below of course) which means a laser-like boost to Stability
      to where you could practically hip-fire the darn thing (no it does not
      drop with Hip-Fire Grip in its perk pool :)

      
      Which set of rolls you go for depends on whether or not you want to keep
      your mod slot open for `Icarus Grip` or `Freehand Grip`. If you don't
      care for either of those, that's going to free up your choice of Barrels
      and you'll be able to throw a `Counterbalance Stock` mod in to fix the
      recoil.
      

      Umbrals drop so regularly and since the season has been extended to
      November, I'm crossing my fingers you get the roll you want!

          Any time you see Dynamic Sway and Tap the Trigger available in both
          columns, that's a tough one to pass up. TtT keeps you steady on the
          initial burst and DSR keeps you steady afterwards. After that it's
          all `Stability`. This roll would push Stability from 39 to 74 (?!) and
          that's not including the additional Stability from DSR and TtT! With a
          Recoil-fixing Barrel, the mod slot is free for you.

      Ehroar thinks the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 might be the
      [best PvE primary in Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sgVvsCK2BM)
      mostly because it can generate Warmind Cells and it has a great perk
      pool. He makes a strong case and with Reach, the nukes are nukey.
      
      
      Note that the IKELOS_SMG also has `Disruption Break` will will proc when
      breaking a Barrier Champion's shield. However no other perks play off of
      it, so I won't feature a set of rolls here for it. Same goes for
      `Demolitionist` which is a great perk but doesn't overtly synergize with
      any of the other perks. As Ehroar points out, `Subsistence` wrecks the
      reserves on the IKELOS, by a whopping 44% (!) so I'm not recommending it
      as a perk.

          Pair this roll with a `Surrounded Spec` mod and you are positively
          shredding through adds. Throw on a single Warmind Cell mod on to your
          armor and you become a nuclear bomb generating Guardian.
