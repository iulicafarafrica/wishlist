    summary: >
      Ehroar and Kackis both review the IKELOS 1.0.2 and land on similar
      reccomendations which I'll capture here. Ehroar's take is a little more
      thorough so I'm expanding the Collector's Edition with his thoughts.

      * [Ikelos Sniper is Back! What is the God Roll?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waOR-IuhIIc) - Ehroar

      * [The Sniper Meta is BACK!? - Best New PvE Sniper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQSfa96KoO4) - Kackis

      
      The core perks are fine, so even though the Baseline is pretty easily
      obtainable, don't let that dissuade you; it's solid!
