    summary: >
      False Promises is a 360 RPM Kinetic Auto Rifle introduced in Season 11.
      Apart from the Age-Old Bond (from the Last Wish raid), it's the only
      other High-Impact Frame Auto Rifle in the game that will be able to go
      past Season 11's `1060` power cap. Gahlran's Right Hand is still
      available from the Crown of Sorrow raid, but will be capped at this
      season's power levels and vaulted next season.
      
      
      The High-Impacts all
      generally have quite good `Range` and pretty awful `Stability`, and
      False Promises is no exception. What we're going to want to focus on is
      increasing the Stability because with no Stability-enhancing perks, it
      can be quite difficult to control.


      This is a case where the difference between console and
      PC is pretty clear with respect to Stability. On PC, Stability is far
      less of an issue, so on YouTube you'll see what looks like an entirely
      different weapon being used. On console, False Promises is pretty tough
      to control. Even at vertical, there's still a lot of bounce in the
      reticle.


      Here's a couple of videos that talk about Stability, esp. with respect to
      Dynamic Sway Reduction. Note that DSR was
      [buffed in S11](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126):

      > Dynamic Sway Reduction: Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds).
      Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.

      
      ...so some of these may be a little out of date depending on which part of
      the content you're referring to.

      * [Stability In Depth | Stat Review and Guide - The Heart of Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQEFdjwzcw&feature=youtu.be)


      I'm recommending, nay 🧐 **requiring** DSR for any False Promises roll I'd
      consider using in PvP. The reason is that False Promises has the worst
      base stats of any 360 RPM Auto Rifle and needs a lot of help getting to a
      usable place in PvP, considering its competition.


      All of the following rolls feature Eye of the Storm, Rampage and
      Swashbuckler. Think about this from a "forgiveness" perspective. If you
      want more forgiveness during your first exchange, choose Eye of the Storm.
      If you want more foregiveness during follow-on encounters, choose Rampage
      or Swashbuckler.

          These 360s are primarily hampered by their ultra-low Stability, so
          we're going to do everything we can to correct it. `EotS` is part of
          that as it hones in progressively more as your health gets low. Be
          sure to swap in Counterbalance mod push the `Recoil` to `100`.

    summary: >
      There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much
      `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting`
      is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage
      bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.
