    summary: >
      False Promises is a 360 RPM Kinetic Auto Rifle introduced in Season 11.
      Apart from the Age-Old Bond (from the Last Wish raid), it's the only
      other High-Impact Frame Auto Rifle in the game that will be able to go
      past Season 11's `1060` power cap. Gahlran's Right Hand is still
      available from the Crown of Sorrow raid, but will be capped at this
      season's power levels and vaulted next season.
      
      
      The High-Impacts all
      generally have quite good `Range` and pretty awful `Stability`, and
      False Promises is no exception. What we're going to want to focus on is
      increasing the Stability because with no Stability-enhancing perks, it
      can be quite difficult to control.


      This is a case where the difference between console and
      PC is pretty clear with respect to Stability. On PC, Stability is far
      less of an issue, so on YouTube you'll see what looks like an entirely
      different weapon being used. On console, False Promises is pretty tough
      to control. Even at vertical, there's still a lot of bounce in the
      reticle.


      Here's a couple of videos that talk about Stability, esp. with respect to
      Dynamic Sway Reduction. Note that DSR was
      [buffed in S11](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126):

      > Dynamic Sway Reduction: Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds).
      Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.

      
      ...so some of these may be a little out of date depending on which part of
      the content you're referring to.

      I'm recommending, nay **requiring** 🧐DSR for any False Promises roll I'd
      consider using in PvP. The reason is that the False Promises has the worst
      base stats of any 360 RPM Auto Rifle and needs a lot of help getting to a
      usable place in PvP, considering its competition. DSR is so good now that
      it almost obviates the need for any other Stability.


      All of the following rolls feature Eye of the Storm, Rampage and
      Swashbuckler. Think about this from a "forgiveness" perspective. If you
      want more forgiveness during your first exchange, choose Eye of the Storm.
      If you want more foregiveness during follow-on encounters, choose Rampage
      or Swashbuckler.

          With how significanly DSR ramps, you're really basing your playstyle
          around it. You know how everyone pre-fires with SUROS? Well I'm
          suggesting a set of rolls based on pre-firing with DSR on Auto Rifles.
          This means instead of a Counterbalance Mod, I want to see room for a
          Backup Mag mod here. This set of rolls is based around "fixing" Recoil
          with barrels, leaving room for a Backup Mag mod to give you more
          pre-firing leeway. Eye of the Storm is terrific for increased accuracy
          during gunfights and the rest of the roll is about adding as much
          Stability as we can.

          Similar set of rolls to the above, but around Stability instead of
          Recoil in the first column, which means there's a slightly increased
          chance of getting one of these to drop (emphasis on 'slightly' 🤪).

          an asbolutely serviceable Auto Rifle.

          If you manage to get every perk but the final column, you have a
          super solid base Auto Rifle. This will be a series of rolls around
          Dynamic Sway Reduction and without the reliance on final-column perks.

    summary: >
      There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much
      `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting`
      is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage
      bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.
