# Welcome to the Sliflist!
This document is generated from a custom Destiny Item Manager "wishlist" and was
created on `#{DateTime.now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %:z")}`. The most recent
version of this document can always be found [here](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/).

These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important.
This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide
on a roll yourself. For example Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are
`Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the
list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails,
those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random
kinetic Auto Rifle.

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't)
that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM
"Wishlist Notes" section (searchable in DIM via `wishlistnotes:`), when it could
do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your
own discretion.

**Some rolls are missing PvE or PvP sections. What gives?** If that's the case,
I'm of the opinion it's not worth chasing ãƒ„
