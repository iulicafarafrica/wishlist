# Welcome!
Did I Strike Gold? Or Silver? Or Bronze? This is what I'm hoping to do with my wishlist. It's not trying to tell you every possible perk that might happen to be good, it's trying to tell you when a set of related perks came together to make an interesting roll.

I tend to play a bit off-meta (well, a lot if you ask my fireteam!) so my goal with these lists is to help me decide what rolls of weapons (even if they aren't "the meta") would be interesting to use in both PvE and PvP. I'll strive to include as much color in the notes of each weapon as I can. These are visible when clicking on a suggested (or rejected) roll in DIM. As the wishlist is updated, so are the thoughts that go in to each set of rolls, which you can find a link to above.

**This is a console-centric wishlist.** If you're on PC, generally you have a Range preference over Stability. Keep that in mind when you see something with a suggested Stability-related perk or a Stability Masterwork, etc.

# Who Made This?
Well, I captured the rolls so ultimately me but the foundation of my knowledge comes from both my own experience and countless video reviews from Fallout, CoolGuy, CammyCakes, etc. and watching footage of the weapons in action from a myriad of content producers and streamers. I quote and link to them where relevant in the [Roll Guide](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/blob/master/thought_process.md).
