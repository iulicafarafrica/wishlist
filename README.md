I tend to play a bit off-meta (well, a lot if you ask my fireteam) so my goal with these lists is to help me decide what rolls of weapons (even if they aren't "the meta") would be solid to use in both PvE and PvP. I'll strive to include as much color in the notes of each weapon as I can.

**Note that no exotics or ritual/pinnacle weapons are included.**
* Exotics there are so few of, you can find a million video reviews of them and they don't drop with random rolls.
* Ritual weapons don't drop with random rolls, and you have to choose to pursue them. My thinking is that they don't randomly wind up in your inventory because you decided to pursue them or not, and have likely looked up one of the countless video reviews.
