[Roll Commentary - Latest Version](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/blob/master/thought_process.md)

# Welcome!
Did I Strike Gold? Or Silver? Or Bronze? This is what I'm hoping to do with my wishlist. It's not trying to tell you every possible perk that might happen to be good, it's trying to tell you when a set of related perks came together to make an interesting roll.

I tend to play a bit off-meta (well, a lot if you ask my fireteam!) so my goal with these lists is to help me decide what rolls of weapons (even if they aren't "the meta") would be interesting to use in both PvE and PvP. I'll strive to include as much color in the notes of each weapon as I can. These are visible when clicking on a suggested (or rejected) roll in DIM. As the wishlist is updated, so are the thoughts that go in to each set of rolls, which you can find a link to above.

**This is a console-centric wishlist.** If you're on PC, generally you have a Range preference over Stability. Keep that in mind when you see something with a suggested Stability-related perk or a Stability Masterwork, etc.

# Who Made This?
I've been playing Destiny since the Alpha with just shy of 3,300 hours played as of February 2019. That's how everyone starts out one of these right? :) Well, I captured the rolls so ultimately I'm responsible for them but all of the creators listed below influenced every single one of these rolls in one or two ways:

1. **Directly**: They reviewed a weapon and shared specific insights as to why and how a particular roll could be effective.
2. **Indirectly**: They published content about how the sandbox itself functions (e.g. how perks work, what the core attributes are, etc.)
  
I quote and link to sources per-weapon in the [Roll Guide](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/blob/master/thought_process.md). Go check out these Destiny scientists and the content they produce. Really amazing stuff. Every roll of every weapon was influenced in some way by their work.

# Sandbox Analysis

If I come across interesting content with respect to how the sandbox basics function, I will share those here. I've taken liberties with some of the video titles to make this list more scannable AND LESS SCREAMING :) Content specific to each weapon is specified in line with its roll guide.

## Weapon Focus: Hand Cannons

* [PART 2 : Range MEANS NOTHING on Hand Cannons (Aim Assist and Accuracy edition)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fxkA3Qcv-w) - [CoolGuy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOitB3h99Ur9RzR5ftd2bA), 2020-02-19
  * What about Range making things "more crispy" or increasing Aim Assist and thereforce accuracy? We can trace this back to comments four years ago, about how Destiny 1 worked: *"Range is one big huge bar that's one giant number of a stat. There's a whole bunch of little things in there. Anything that effects accuracy or target acquisition can touch its little part of the Range bar independent of Range itself. We've made a couple of perks and scopes that give you a slight bonus to target acquisition (Aim Assist). Generally a +5 or +10 to where it would be on the Range stat value. This is Bungie's secret sauce as to how they make shooters feel so good; one of the many things. If your Range is higher, your Aim Assist is going to be better."* - Crucible Radio, Episode 16 (2015/10/05) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwyGYiGwp2U) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/3njyek/crucible_radio_ep_16_secrets_revealed_with/)
  * What was the main reason we wanted to know what he was talking about? Destiny 1's "Ghost Bullets" (you'd be on target within range and completely miss). "What we needed Range for in Destiny 1 is not what we need from Range in Destiny 2. Whatever multiplier was placed on accuracy in Destiny 1 is significantly different now."
  * Shoots four shots with an Austringer:
    * Austringer 1: 92 stability, 52 range (max damage, 26.5m). At 34m, crits for 50.
    * Austringer 2: 63 stability, 69 range (max damage, 29m). At 37m, crits for 50 - because of Rangefinder.
    * In both cases, all four shots hit in succession at max rate of fire and max range (i.e. no "Ghost Bullets").
  * Next, he takes Austringer 1, shoots headshots at the max rate of fire at 44m which hits for the damage floor (24). If you add more Range, "the shots aren't getting any crispier".
  * **If you can get 100% accuracy at the damage floor at max range, what could increasing your range possibly help you with, with respect to accuracy?**
  * Adding **Aim Assist** widens the accuracy cone, which is still important. You can verify this by looking at the circle around your reticle (higher AA = wider accuracy cone).
    * Adding 30 more Range to a Hand Cannon can't be felt, but adding more 30 Stability can be. Adding Stability also increases the rate at which the AA cone shrinks/resets.
  * What about Hand Cannon rolls in general?
    * "When I get a Hand Cannon, it's perks first then barrels, mags and masterworks next."
    * "The three things I would worry about are (1) the actual Aim Assist stat (2) accuracy-boosting perks, Targeting Adjuster, Enhanced HC Targeting, etc. and (3) your connection to host, but you can't test it or control it."
    * "When it comes to Hand Cannons, all rolls are kinda good. If you farmed a max range roll back when, if you farm a max Stability roll now, it's stil good. You won't be at a severe disadvantage for doing so and I think that was their point all along with these changes."
* [PART 1 : Range MEANS NOTHING on Hand Cannons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSSO1ugSAeE) - [CoolGuy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOitB3h99Ur9RzR5ftd2bA), 2019-10-28
  * Adding Range to a Hand Cannon has minimal gain. "You shouldn't dismantle a great Hand Cannon roll because it isn't max range." When you add on Range to a Hand Cannon you get minimal gains: (35 Range = 25m falloff, 86 Range = 28m)

## Weapon Focus: Shotguns
This will have its own section both because of how popular they are, how confusing they are and how much misconception/misinformation there is floating around. Notice the timestamps on these videos. I'll do my best to call out when information changes over time.

  * [Rifled Barrel vs Full Choke, Which is Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbH45R4LBYY) - [Fallout Plays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlqYSFcNTrxDQO_T9GCsjg), 2019-09-19
    * Tested both barrels on all four shotgun archetypes because there was a common misconception that barrels perform differently on different archetypes (they do not).
    * "I wouldn't say there's a clear cut winner but I would say that `Full Choke` seems *more likely* to get a better pellet spread. It's possible to use `Rifled Barrel` and get a better pellet spread than Full Choke, by chance. ... The winner by a hair is `Full Choke`."
    * "Both barrels are great. If you're chasing a God Roll Dust Rock with an almost perfect roll and `Rifled Barrel`, you should feel great about that."
    * "Want a good OHK PvP Shotgun? You want: (1) high impact (2) `Full Choke` (`Rifled Barrel` also fine) (3) the highest possible range for that archetype (4) A long barrel."
  * [Range Does Nothing? (on Shotguns)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmONoAaw95I) - [Fallout Plays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlqYSFcNTrxDQO_T9GCsjg), 2019-07-22
    * Tested two high-impact shotguns with different ranges and a third with lower impact and higher range and "The higher-ranged shotguns were able to more consistently deal more damage."
    * "It's not that range doesn't matter, it's that it doesn't matter as much as a high impact stat or a good pellet spread. It's not a make or break stat. If you have a shotgun with gigantic impact, you should feel good about it even if it doesn't have max range for its category. It can still get the job done for sure, barring a little bit of RNG here and there. I will continue continue to reccomend Range Masterworks on most shotguns in my God Roll videos not because it's wildly amazing, just because it's kinda the best option out of everything on the table."
  * [Shotgun OHK Range Nerf, Before & After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GygQj90cTRY) - [Fallout Plays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlqYSFcNTrxDQO_T9GCsjg), 2019-03-07
    * In Season of the Drifter (March 2019) there were [several material changes to shotguns](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47638).
      * *Full Auto rate-of-fire bonus for Shotguns is now +10%, down from +100%.*
      * *In addition, it no longer increases the Shotgun pellet spread.*
      * *We also took the opportunity to slightly adjust Shotguns for the Crucible. While Shotguns will remain effective in the Crucible, we have toned down the range at which Shotguns could secure a one-shot kill.* (translation: they lowered shotgun base damage)
    * If you recall, rapid-fires used to be super popular in Crucible because they could two-tap at 11m with an insane rate of fire - no longer!
    * New "Consistent" OHK ranges:
      * Precison (excepting Slugs): 8m (e.g. Well-rolled Dust Rock Blues)
      * Aggressive: 8m (e.g. Curated Mindbender, [Botheration](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1457394910/botheration-mk28/))
      * Lightweight: 6m (two-tap @ 9m)
      * Rapid-Fire: 5m (two-tap @ 9m)
      * Chaperone: 13m (15m with Roadborn active)
      * Legend of Acrius: 9m
    * "Both `Full Choke` and `Rifled Barrel` should remain your barrels of choice."
  * [Is Full Choke Still Good? (Destiny 2 patch/shotgun update)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkpKCspRBG4) - [Fallout Plays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlqYSFcNTrxDQO_T9GCsjg), 2018-11-01
    * "Still" is in reference to a patch that nerfed Full Choke in late 2018. It was previously the go-to barrel choice for shotguns.
    * Range on shotguns appears to affect pellet spread ([timestamp](https://youtu.be/SkpKCspRBG4?t=247)).
    * "More often than not, `Full Choke` is still going to have a tighter spread than any other barrel option, which makes it a good pick because your odds of hitting with more pellets is slightly higher."
    * "`Full Choke` I would say is more consistent at realistic ranges, but `Rifled Barrel` can also get the job done especially if, for whatever reason, you're trying to get a lucky kill past the very edge of the damage dropoff point."
    * "But what about losing precision damage with `Full Choke`???"
      * "Losing precision damage with `Full Choke` from close to medium range hardly matters. Precision pellet damage is minor (Slif: 24 versus 26 in the screenshot he showed), and more often than not your goal is to just hit as many pellets as you can, anywhere on the target that you can."
      * "The extra damage is nothing compared to how many more pellets you'll hit with with `Full Choke` on average."
    * "Aggressive Frame shotguns benefit way more from `Full Choke` due to their naturally low range. Precision Frame shotguns that already have very high range (and I mean very high, like a God Roll Dust Rock Blues or Retold Tale) may not need `Full Choke` after a certain point. Don't quote me on that though; more research is needed."

    * Holy Trinity: Impact > Pellet Spread >>>>> Range
    * "It's not that Range does nothing, it's just at the bottom of the totem pole. Impact is king; it always trumps Range."

## Weapon Focus: Swords

[Fallout Plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9HcFqLdlyQ) put together a terrific in-depth analysis of everything Swords. If you know of any other content, please let me know!

* There are three sword frames
  * **Lightweight**: Usable only by Hunters. There are two of these swords.
  * **Adaptive**: Usable by all classes. While Warlocks do not have a specific type dedicate to them, they do have unique access to the `Infinite Guard` perk.
  * **Aggressive**: Usable only by Titans. There are two of these as well.

* Attributes unique to swords
  * **Charge Rate**: How fast your Sword Energy replenishes, which is
  what gates your ability to block and perform heavy attacks. Swordmaster's Guard is the only Guard that increases Charge Rate which (for Falling Guillotine at least) means you can use your Heavy Attack ~0.5s more often.
  * **Guard Endurance**: How fast your Sword Energy depletes *while in the guard animation*.
  * **Guard Efficiency**: How fast your Sword Energy depletes *while getting shot*.
  * **Guard Resistance**: How much damage your Guardian takes while... guarding.

* A few things to know about how Heavy attacks work:
  * They deplete your Sword Energy!
  * When your Sword Energy is full: Uses `4` ammo, does maximum damage.
  * When your Sword Energy is not full: Uses `1` ammo, does significantly less damage. The learning here is that *you probably never want to be spamming Heavy attacks!*

* Are you crazy enough to want to take a sword in to PvP?
  * *Lightweight* and *Adaptive* frames must use a Heavy attack to kill a roaming super. *Aggressive* frames can use a Light attack.
  * You're probably going to want to focus on *Guard Efficiency* and *Guard Resistance*.

* Perks that Increase Damage
  * **En Garde**: In PvP, a light attack can already kill a guardian. No need for it in PvP. In PvE, the duration is 1.5s. There are better options.
  * **Assassin's Blade**: 15% extra damage + faster sprinting for 5s. In PvP, damage doesn't matter. Movement speed is fun.
  * **Shattering Blade**: +25% extra heavy attack damage when depleting ammo. Pass.
  * **Surrounded**: Not necessary in PvP - not only because you're unlikely to proc it, but that a single light swing already kills full health guardians. In PvE, solid! +25% base, +35% with Surrounded Spec!
  * **Whirlwind Blade**: Premier damage-dealing perk! Stacks to five, once per light swing. +6% per stack to 30% (x5) with a 3.5s duration. Each hit extends the duration.

* Perks That Encourage Blocking
  * **Energy Transfer**: Straightforward, works great, nice to have but "eh".
  * **Counterattack**: You have to take damage right when you activate guard.
  * **Flash Counter**: Debuffs the enemy that attacks you. They take 20% more damage from all incoming damage! This is the counter to ground-pounder bosses. This only drops on the Honor's Edge sword.

* Ammo Regeneration Perks
  * **Tireless Blade**: Only gives you `1` ammo back after multiple heavy attacks. Pass.
  * **Relentless Strikes**: Gives you back sword ammo on repeated hits. Seems like it's bugged currently and giving you more ammo back than it should. Pairs great with *Whirlwind Blade*.

## Weapon Focus: Bows

*6/26/2020 - This section is nascent; needs a lot of work. Unfortunately not a ton of bow 'science' out there, so this will be slow going.*

  * **`Draw Time`** Is the one unique stat for bows.
    * Every twenty points in Draw Time equates to 0.03 seconds, or one frame at 30 fps.
    * Lightweight bows are the fastest and have a floor of 540 (i.e. any decrease beyond this will not take affect).
    * It does not affect Bow impact in the way that `Charge Time` affects Fusion Rifle impact.
