## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/)
We're looking for ways to keep increased DPS for longer, with Osmosis thrown in for high-end PvE w/Match Game. For a PvE roll, barrel, first-column and masterwork perks are gravy. We're looking for: (Feeding Frenzy, Subsistence) + (Swashbuckler, Multikill Clip, Osmosis)
## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/)
Range is super low on the Steelfeather. We can get Recoil to 100 with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance mod to slightly compensate, and run Void to get bonus Stability with Elemental Capacitor. We're looking for: Arrowhead Brake + (HCR, Ricochet) + Elemental Capacitor + Range MW
## Breachlight (PvE)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/)
Some neat PvE combos here from Ehroar's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY demoing a general purpose great roll along with two specialized rolls for Warlocks. As with most other PvE rolls, scopes and masterworks, etc. are more flexible and don't materially change the roll.
## Breachlight (PvP)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/)
Pretty much any roll of Breachlight is going to do well in the Crucible and honestly, Smuggler's Word with Tap-the-Trigger is arguably better. With sidearms (and well, all weapons in general) I opt for perks to secure the initial kill in PvP. We're looking for (Hammer-forged, Smallbore) + Accurized Rounds + Threat Detector + Quickdraw + Range Masterwork
## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2723241847/patron-of-lost-causes/)
CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s. For PvE, it's the only scout (as of now) that can roll Vorpal and Osmosis. Not a super high priority for PvE and not a terribly hard set of perks to farm.
## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2723241847/patron-of-lost-causes/)
CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s. I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls as we're looking for (Smallbore, Corkscrew, Chambered, Polygonal, Fluted) + (Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell) + Rapid Hit + (Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor)
## Line in the Sand (PvE)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/946443267/line-in-the-sand/)
I only suggest this for completeness (legendary arc LFR in the power slot). It's not that great. Make it your lowest priority farm. Thank you Ehroar! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0. We're looking for Rapid Hit + Firing Line.
## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3850168899/martyrs-retribution/)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go. We're looking for (Countermass, Smart Drift Control, Quick Launch, Hard Launch) + (Auto Loading Holster, Threat Detector) + demolitionist + (Any Masterwork). Threat Detector might seem odd, but it increases reload speed and because this GL doesn't do any impact damage, it will have great reload up close.
## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3850168899/martyrs-retribution/)
This is for use from range, and Blast Radius doesn't do anything on Wave Frame launchers - simple wishlist here :) We're looking for (Smart Drift Control, Quick Launch) + Auto Loading Holster + Elemental Capacitor + (Reload, Handling MW). Why not demolitionist? You're not going to get final blows with this so much in PvP and with ALH, it will always be loaded. I'd rather have better handling or reload with Elemental Capacitor always-on.
## Gallant Charge (PvE)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/)
Fusions don't totally shine in PvE but with Demolitionist this could be interesting. Add in Swashbuckler for an instant x5 on melee kills (over Rampage) and you have an interesting one to consider. Barrels, magazines and masterworks don't matter too much here.
## Gallant Charge (PvP)
[View on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/)
Gallant Charge is to Stability as Erentil is to Range. If you want great range, farm an Erentil from Menagerie. I want something different so these rolls are all about maximizing stability wherever possible. We're looking for (Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator) + Particle Repeater + Demolitionist + Tap the Trigger + Stability MW.
