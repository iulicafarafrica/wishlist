These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important. This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide on a roll yourself. E.g. Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails, those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random kinetic Auto Rifle :)

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't) that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM "Notes" section, when it could do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your own discretion.
## Line in the Sand (PvE)
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?

|  | (Any barrel) `and` (Accelerated Coils) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Firing Line) `and` (Charge MW) |
| **(PvE) Baseline** | Really, any roll with these two perks is Good Enough(tm). |

## Breachlight (PvP)
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw, it's just another two-burst sidearm, which is great but you don't need a wishlist for that :)

| Roll | Details |
| :--- | :---        |
| **(PvP) Slif's Super Picky** | This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range. |
|  | (Full Bore `or` Hammer-Forged Rifling `or` Smallbore `or` Extended Barrel) `and` (Accurized Rounds) `and` (Threat Detector) `and` (Vorpal) `and` (Range MW) |
| **(PvP) Super Picky** | Any roll in this set would give you an A+ PvP roll. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw in the final column, you're better off using a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger. |
|  | (Full Bore `or` Hammer-Forged Rifling `or` Smallbore `or` Extended Barrel) `and` (Accurized Rounds) `and` (Threat Detector `or` Demolitionist `or` Outlaw) `and` (Vorpal `or` Quickdraw) `and` (Range MW) |
| **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus MW and Accurized)** | Same as before, minus the Range MW and Accurized Rounds since you have only a 25% to get each of them. This is still an amazing roll. |
|  | (Full Bore `or` Hammer-Forged Rifling `or` Smallbore `or` Extended Barrel) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Threat Detector `or` Demolitionist `or` Outlaw) `and` (Vorpal `or` Quickdraw) `and` (Any masterwork) |
| **(PvP) Baseline** | You've got basically a 50% chance of getting this roll :) Yes it would be awesome to have +20 range from Accurized and a Range MW but it's still a great weapon. |
|  | (Full Bore `or` Hammer-Forged Rifling `or` Smallbore `or` Extended Barrel) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Any perk) `and` (Vorpal `or` Quickdraw) `and` (Any masterwork) |
## Breachlight (PvE)
Some neat PvE combos here from [Ehroar's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) and general [PvE wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) from CoolGuy. I kind of love Breachlight so I'm going to lay down a bunch of possibilities here.

## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvP)
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! Paraphrased: There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (Slif: ?!). Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few of these. Keep in mind they don't benefit from from the S92 benefit of an additional perk in the last slot, so it can be a bit painful.

| Roll | Details |
| :--- | :---        |
| **(PvP) Picky Tapping** | Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and Tap procs on every other burst. Going for max range after that. |
|  | (Any barrel) `and` (High-Caliber Rounds `or` Ricochet Rounds `or` Armor-Piercing Rounds) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Tap the Trigger) `and` (Range MW) |

|  | (Any barrel) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Tap the Trigger) `and` (Any masterwork) |
| **(PvP) Picky Shieldbreaker** | Disruption Break works in PvP apparently!? Same set of rolls as above, but pairing with Disruption Break instead of Tap the Trigger. |
|  | (Any barrel) `and` (High-Caliber Rounds `or` Ricochet Rounds `or` Armor-Piercing Rounds) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Disruption Break) `and` (Range MW) |

| **(PvE) Picky Shieldbreaker** | Don't Sleep on Disruption Break! CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks can be applied to sidearm. That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk! |
|  | (Any barrel) `and` (Armor-Piercing Rounds) `and` (Rapid Hit `or` Feeding Frenzy) `and` (Disruption Break) `and` (Any masterwork) |

CoolGuy [dropping serious knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) here. "Currently they're the only frame I wouldn't take in to 5500 Comp. Use Rapid-fire frame." Here's what I put together from the video.

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

## Gallant Charge (PvP)
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.

| Roll | Details |
| :--- | :---        |
| **(PvP) Super Picky Stability** | Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability! |

## Gallant Charge (PvE)
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon).

| Roll | Details |

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls. Randy's is in the same slot and has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip already, so I'm not losing too much sleep about getting a perfect roll here.

| Roll | Details |
| :--- | :---        |
| **(PvP) Super Picky** | This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better. |
|  | (Smallbore `or` Corkscrew Rifling `or` Chambered Compensator `or` Polygonal Rifling `or` Fluted Barrel) `and` (Tactical Mag `or` Steady Rounds `or` Flared Magwell) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Explosive Rounds `or` Elemental Capacitor `or` Vorpal) `and` (Stability MW) |
| **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Barrels)** | Same as above, minus the barrels |

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
This is the only Scout Rifle that can roll Vorpal or Osmosis. This isn't a high priority roll for you to go after and it's also pretty much the core components of the PvP rolls we have down already. With the S92 double-perk bonus, you should be able to get one of these pretty promptly :)

## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for velocity, reload and handling wherever I can get it. The base Velocity is `76` and since the second column perks are fixed, that's a flat `+9` so we're at `84`. That seems more than good enough, so lets focus on reload + handling. There's only one roll here because it's not that hard to farm.

| Roll | Details |
| :--- | :---        |
| **(PvP) Super Picky** | Threat Detector has such a long proc range that I'm going to put it on par with Auto-Loading Holster here. We can choose (or not choose) to use the reload and handling boosts on Elemental Capacitor, paired with the masterworks. Don't forget a `Quick Access Sling` mod! |
|  | (Countermass `or` Quick Launch `or` Smart Drift Control) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Threat Detector `or` Auto-Loading Holster) `and` (Elemental Capacitor) `and` (Reload MW `or` Handling MW) |
| **(PvP) Picky** | Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor which is the hardest to get out of the other perks. |
|  | (Countermass `or` Quick Launch `or` Smart Drift Control) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Threat Detector `or` Auto-Loading Holster) `and` (Any perk) `and` (Reload MW `or` Handling MW) |
## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.

| Roll | Details |
| :--- | :---        |
| **(PvE) The Instant Reloader** | We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly? |
|  | (Countermass `or` Quick Launch `or` Smart Drift Control) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Auto-Loading Holster `or` Threat Detector `or` Field Prep) `and` (Demolitionist) `and` (Reload MW) |
| **(PvE) Shieldbreaker** | Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on... |
|  | (Countermass `or` Quick Launch `or` Smart Drift Control) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Genesis) `and` (Demolitionist) `and` (Reload MW `or` Handling MW) |
