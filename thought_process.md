## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
We're going for straight-up recoil and insane stability here. We can get Recoil to 100 with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance mod. We're looking for: Arrowhead Brake + (HCR, Ricochet) + Firmly Planted + Elemental Capacitor + Stability MW ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/))
## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
We're looking for ways to keep increased DPS for longer, with Osmosis thrown in for high-end PvE w/Match Game and since we can roll two perks, why not Vorpal? For a PvE roll, barrel, first-column and masterwork perks are gravy. We're looking for: Feeding Frenzy + (Swashbuckler + Vorpal, Osmosis + Vorpal) ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/))
## Steelfeather Repeater (Garbo)
Given how farmable these are, anything with Subsistence, Slideways, Grave Robber or Ambitious Assassin in the third slot isn't worth keeping. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/))
## Breachlight (PvE)
Some neat PvE combos here from Ehroar's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY demoing a general purpose great roll along with two specialized rolls for Warlocks. As with most other PvE rolls, scopes and masterworks, etc. are more flexible and don't materially change the roll. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/))
## Breachlight (PvP)
Pretty much any roll of Breachlight is going to do well in the Crucible and honestly, Smuggler's Word with Tap-the-Trigger is arguably better. With sidearms (and well, all weapons in general) I opt for perks to secure the initial kill in PvP. We're looking for (Hammer-forged, Smallbore) + Accurized Rounds + Threat Detector + Quickdraw + Range Masterwork ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/))
## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s. For PvE, it's the only scout (as of now) that can roll Vorpal and Osmosis. Not a super high priority for PvE and not a terribly hard set of perks to farm. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2723241847/patron-of-lost-causes/))
## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s. I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls as we're looking for (Smallbore, Corkscrew, Chambered, Polygonal, Fluted) + (Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell) + Rapid Hit + (Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor) + Stability MW ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2723241847/patron-of-lost-causes/))
## Patron of Lost Causes (Garbo)
Anything without Rapid Hit :) ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2723241847/patron-of-lost-causes/))
## Line in the Sand (PvE)
I only suggest this for completeness (legendary arc LFR in the power slot). It's not that great. Make it your lowest priority farm. Thank you Ehroar! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0. We're looking for Rapid Hit + Firing Line. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/946443267/line-in-the-sand/))
## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go. We're looking for (Countermass, Smart Drift Control, Quick Launch, Hard Launch) + (Auto Loading Holster, Threat Detector) + demolitionist + (Any Masterwork). Threat Detector might seem odd, but it increases reload speed and because this GL doesn't do any impact damage, it will have great reload up close. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3850168899/martyrs-retribution/))
## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
This is for use from range, and Blast Radius doesn't do anything on Wave Frame launchers - simple wishlist here :) We're looking for (Smart Drift Control, Quick Launch) + Auto Loading Holster + Elemental Capacitor + (Reload, Handling MW). Why not demolitionist? You're not going to get final blows with this so much in PvP and with ALH, it will always be loaded. I'd rather have better handling or reload with Elemental Capacitor always-on. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3850168899/martyrs-retribution/))
## Gallant Charge (PvE)
Fusions don't totally shine in PvE but with Demolitionist this could be interesting. Add in Swashbuckler for an instant x5 on melee kills (over Rampage) and you have an interesting one to consider. Barrels, magazines and masterworks don't matter too much here. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/))
## Gallant Charge (PvP)
Gallant Charge is to Stability as Erentil is to Range. If you want great range, farm an Erentil from Menagerie. I want something different so these rolls are all about maximizing stability wherever possible. We're looking for (Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator) + Particle Repeater + Demolitionist + Tap the Trigger + Stability MW. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/))
## Infinite Paths 8 (PvE)
CoolGuy dropping serious knowledge here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE. "Great for mid and low-tier adds." We're going for either Demo+Dragon (don't forget a dragonfly spec!) or Grave Robber + Swashbuckler. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3233390913/infinite-paths-8/))
## Infinite Paths 8 (PvP)
CoolGuy dropping serious knowledge here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE. "Currently they're the only frame I wouldn't take in to 5500 Comp. Use Rapid-fire frame." If you want some rolls, here's what I put together from the video: Arrowhead Brake + Steady Rounds + Moving Target + (Zen Moment, Swashbuckler) + Stability MW ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3233390913/infinite-paths-8/))
## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvE)
CoolGuy brings the heat again! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4. We're looking for (Rapid Hit, Feeding Frenzy) + (Disruption Break, Dragonfly). Watch the video to see why Disruption Break is recommended :) ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4149758318/travelers-judgment-5/))
## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvP)
CoolGuy brings the heat again! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4. We're looking for (HCR, Armor-Piercing, Richochet) + Rapid-Hit + Tap the Trigger ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4149758318/travelers-judgment-5/))
## Traveler's Judgement 5 (Garbo)
Given how farmable these are, anything with Firmly Planted, Auto-Loading Holster, Hip-fire Grip or Field Prep we can pass on. For single-shot sidearms, you can make the case for hip-fire but not on these multi-burst IMHO. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4149758318/travelers-judgment-5/))
