# Welcome to the Sliflist!
This document is generated from a custom Destiny Item Manager "wishlist" and was
created on `2020-04-13 03:43:10 +00:00`. The most recent
version of this document can always be found [here](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/).

These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important.
This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide
on a roll yourself. For example Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are
`Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the
list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails,
those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random
kinetic Auto Rifle.

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't)
that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM
"Wishlist Notes" section (searchable in DIM via `wishlistnotes:`), when it could
do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your
own discretion.

**Some rolls are missing PvE or PvP sections. What gives?** If that's the case,
I'm of the opinion it's not worth chasing ツ

## Seventh Seraph Carbine - PvP
*The best discussion I've seen on Seraph weapons comes from the [Massive Breakdown podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown). Hit me up if you're seeing solid discussion/dissection elsewhere!*

[Carbine compared to other randomly-rolled 450 RPM Autos](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;Bqp0Wx;mJ1-6)

In Season 10, 450 RPM Precision Frame Auto Rifles like the Carbine aren't part of the PvP meta. It does have a best-in-class base Recoil of `74` meaning you can safely choose other barrels than Arrowhead Brake or Chambered Compensator (although Chambered is still fine!). It's also the only Auto Rifle available now in the game that can roll Vorpal.

Given the Carbine's super low Aim Assist, I suggest a `Targeting Adjuster` mod for all PvP rolls.
* **(PvP) Mercules "Vault it Until the Meta Changes" 🔒Collector's Edition (0.5% chance)**: Marcules isn't a fan of this in PvP, but there have been times where the meta has shifted as it did in S10 towards 600 RPM Adaptive Autos. There's certainly a chance 450s see a change in the future. If you happen across a high-stability roll, he suggests vaulting.
  ```

  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Moving Target, Rangefinder
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) "Vault It" 🔒(Relaxed MW) (1.9% chance)**: We get Stability from our Barrels or Magazines; can afford to lose out on Stability MW. Reload and Handling Masterworks would be solid choices here too. You won't see too much benefit from Range, but it never hurts.

## Seventh Seraph Carbine - PvE
For its **base stats and perks**, there isn't a whole lot of reason to consider the Carbine for PvE. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon, is also 450RPM and recently received a buff in Season 10. It positively shreds in PvE and since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10 Artifact mods.

"OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"
1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take Overload mods (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods I'm sure).
1. It's a Seraph weapon, and if you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.

"Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else 😃
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈 (0.7% chance)**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvP
Mercules and Kyt [aren't super hot](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown#t=33:44) on the Officer's Revolver.

> **Mercules:** *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon except for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil then the Officer's. Statistically, Officer's is not a super impressive hand cannon."*

Contrast that with [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM), who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM) wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.
> **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes it special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not the best stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those stats available on a 180."*

If you're more in the Mercules/Kyt camp, you're looking for the standard solid set of Range-prioritizing base stats. If that's the case, Officer's Revolver won't be a super exciting gun for you and I suggest you check out other hand cannons in this slot! (e.g. Spare Rations, Austringer, Dire Promise, Old Fashioned, ...)
* **(PvP) Drewsky's "Range First" Collector's Edition 🏔 (0.1% chance)**: Drewsky: *"Prioritizing Range while giving the best oveall stat package possible."* On Precision Hand Cannons the accuracy cone doesn't bloom much and recovers quickly. Given that Stability would help us with that, and Stabilty is very good, we're going to focus on other perks. Wait what? Timed Payload?! You said other perks but wow... that's supposed to be positively horrible. It causes double the flinch and the explosion has no range falloff. "But it lowers your TTK!" On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload shouldn't delay TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the math) meaning you get the kill on the last bullet, not on the last 17 damage from Timed Payload.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvE
There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my preferred.

"OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"
1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods I'm sure).
1. It's a Seraph weapon, and if you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.

"Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈 (2.8% chance)**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics.

* **(PvE) Warmind Cell Generator (Aggressive) ☄️ (3.6% chance)**: If you like the look, feel and sound of the Officer's Revolver as I do, and you want a little variety in your Kinetics, this is a fine roll. You'll do solid work with in lower/middle tier PvE content (e.g. your daily bounty grinds, Vanguard Strike playlist).

## Seventh Seraph SI-2 - PvP
The SI-2 is the 2020 version of the Anonymous Autumn (Kyt: *"which is the best-in-class for lightweight sidearms"*) and is the only other randomly rolled 360 RPM Energy sidearm. Mercules is on the same page: *"It (SI-2) doesn't have great Stability or great Range. I would pick a well-rolled Anonymous Autumn over this every time."* Why do they say that? It's got basically the same stats as an Anonymous Autumn but has 33% less Range and 20% less Stability. On the plus side the SI-2 has 7% better Handling (64 > 69) 🙃

Even TrueVanguard, who absolutely loves the Anonymous Autumn (with over 14,000 kills) depicts the SI-2 as situational, relying primarily on Vorpal to justify using it. Check out [his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCtP2PjAEgY).

If you are going to consider the SI-2 for PvP, a few things to keep in mind:
* The recoil direction is 95, so no need to worry about straightening it out. I.e. the +Recoil barrels shouldn't be your first pick. Instead, focus on Range and Stability.
* Full Auto is going to be a make-or-break perk for some, as many guardians have a love-it-or-hate-it relationsihp with single-shot sidearms. If that's your thing, know that no other perk in that column is a must-have. I find that 360s are unsuable for me without it, so I'll be picking one of these up to see how it plays with Vorpal. 

On to the rolls!
* **(PvP) Preference - Full Auto Trigger System (0.8% chance)**: Vorpal is really the key here. Without Vorpal, you're better off using the better-rolled Anonymous Autumn as mentioned above. Otherwise we're going for +Range and +Stability wherever we can get it.

  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Vorpal

## Seventh Seraph SI-2 - PvE
Like all other Seraph weapons, the SI-2 contributes to the generation of Warmind cells in PvE. If that's not your thing, you can pretty much pass on this weapon full stop. It could have made beautiful, beautiful music with the `Wrath of Rasputin` Warmind mod: `Solar splash damage final blows have a chance to create Warmind Cells`. Unfortunately the SI-2 is a Void weapon 👿

That being said, there are a few combos that could prove interesting for the discerning collector / sidearm aficionado.
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying! 🎇 (2.8% chance)**: The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod from Ada-1!
  ```

* **(PvE) Champion Slayer 🏆 (2.8% chance)**: Sidearms are all the rage in the Season 10 Artifact, and certainly will be again at some point in the future. If you want to dump rounds in to Champions, you don't have any other options in this slot.

## Breachlight - PvP
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal, it's just another two-burst sidearm. You may as well use a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger, which has one of the lowest TTKs in all of Destiny.
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥 (0.2% chance)**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.

## Breachlight - PvE
Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below. You won't see obviously good rolls here (e.g. Outlaw + MKC) because the combination is so straightforward and easy to roll. I.e. you don't need to come to a DIM wishlist to tell you that these perks pair well togther :)
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger (3.0% chance)**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake. The lack of a Range Masterwork, or any specific Masterwork doesn't make or break this roll so I'm leaving it out.

## Gallant Charge - PvP
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time. There's not too many rolls here because it's not really worth running unless you get enough stat differentiation to make it more valuable than your dozens of alternatives in this crowded Energy slot.
* **(PvP) Fallout Stabile Zapper Collector's Edition ✨ (1.3% chance)**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!

## Gallant Charge - PvE
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon). The important perks are your third and fourth column for these rolls, so really any of them are fine.

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvP
CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK. They're the only ones he feels are not currently competitive. Given that they used to be the best frames in D1 (remember Hawksaw?), file one away for a future date.
* **(PvP) "CoolGuy's Middle Child" Collector's Edition (0.0% chance)**: In the video above, CoolGuy makes a strong case for some buffs to this "middle" archetype of Pulse Rifle. "On console, Zen Moment and Eye of the Storm are great but you're going to get more utility from Zen Moment." We'll add EotS in later as a fallback.

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvE
Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available? "It performs as expected. Great for mid- and low-tier adds. It does really well."

These rolls are just north of 2% because of the number of perks in the final two columns `(0.16 * 0.16 = 0.02)`, and the fact that they don't benefit from the Season 9 Rank 92 bonus of an additional perk in the final column.
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon 🐉 (2.2% chance)**: This is the one of the few weapons in the game that can roll with Demolitionist + Dragonfly. Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist.
  ```
  Barrels [100%]: *
  Mags    [ 78%]: Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Drop Mag, Alloy Magazine
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Dragonfly

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvP
This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons and the only other Energy HCs apart from Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u) with `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling! For analysis and gameplay, check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and medium range one is about half a meter". Yes for falloff that's true, but since Range affects stickyness, it's still got value here. For some of us (myself included), [CoolGuy's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5CjuOonRc) on the JKQ3 might be more up your alley, PvP-wise: "For Crucible it isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s kind of an acquired taste." It's never clicked with me but some people absolutely love it. IMHO similar to Sunshot - it's great on paper but the model is so chunky that it obscures where you're aiming when it kicks up. Its stiff competition and model/kick funkyness are why these rolls are so narrow. It needs a lot to compete with Luna's, Not Forgotten and Waking Vigil (which can be farmed from Menagerie with a predetermined Masterwork). The second set of these rolls is meant to be slightly more forgiving if you really want Demo and/or Snapshot.
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (0.1% chance)**: Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get  this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much Stability and Handling as we can get.
  ```

  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Snapshot

  ```
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (Sans Demo) (0.3% chance)**: The first thing we're going to do is remove Demo from the list of required perks. The roll is top-tier without it.

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvE
[Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ): "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and  Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns. CoolGuy has a [great set of rolls](https://youtu.be/XI5CjuOonRc?t=463) I'm incorporating here as well. "Very stout PvE hand cannon; top-tier."
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky) (2.0% chance)**: Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't forget Dragonfly Spec! Per CoolGuy, this is a rarely available combo; pick it up.
  ```
  Barrels [ 93%]: Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS

  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Dragonfly

  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) The Never-Ending Reloader (Super Picky) (2.0% chance)**: You'll almost never have to reload here, because getting kills with the sustained DPS perks will give you your grenade back and using your grenade will reload the magazine.
  ```

## Line in the Sand - PvP

## Line in the Sand - PvE
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
* **(PvE) Super Picky DPS (0.3% chance)**: The full suite of perks to maximize DPS on a big ol' target. We're looking for some Stability-enhancing barrels as well.

## Martyr's Retribution - PvP
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for Reload and Velocity in that order. The base Velocity @ `86` and Reload @ `77` (thanks to `High-Velocity Rounds` being one of two fixed barrels) seems more than good enough, so lets focus on Reload and Handling. I don't require Demolitionist because like Fighting Lion, I see Martyr's more as a starter than a finisher. By all means, roll with it, but I'm more excited about the perks below because I think we'll get more consistent utility from them. With breach-load launchers, we're going to run `Quick Access Sling`, which buffs swapping speed and since the Martyr's Handling stat is already so high, I don't think we need too much more Handling here. Let's look for Velocity-based barrels and since there's only two available magazines, that choice is easy ;)
* **(PvP) Super Picky (1.5% chance)**: Elemental Capacitor's +Reload and +Handling buffs (Solar and Arc respectively) are pheneomenal attributes to bump on breach load launchers.

## Martyr's Retribution - PvE
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker (5.3% chance)**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...

## Patron of Lost Causes - PvP / PvE
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). Since this is a controller wishlist, these rolls are all about maxing Stability. All of these PvP rolls would be perfectly fine rolls in PvE as well.
* **(PvP/PvE) "Rapid Hitstability" (1.6% chance)**: This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better.

* **(PvP/PvE) Rapid Rangestability (1.4% chance)**: Maybe even though you're on controller, you like your Stability with a side of Range? Listen, I'm not the boss of you. Range barrels are a great option with this roll as well, but I think, less desirable hence their place in the batting order.

## Perfect Paradox - PvP
Rapid-fire frames in PvP are a different breed. They're not like Aggressive or Precision Frames for the spicy, consistent one-hit kills. If you want something like that in this slot, you want to farm Menagerie for [Dust Rock Blues](https://www.light.gg/db/items/636912560/dust-rock-blues/) or even [Toil and Trouble](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2957367743/toil-and-trouble/).

The big debate here will be Opening Shot or Rampage. Many folks, like Sheikh (aka [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEmXDccobw)) prefer Rampage + Rampage Spec in the final slot. I don't and here's why:

1. Rapid-fire frames require 12 pellets to kill. Each tier of Rampage decreases the number of pellets needed by one. Here's DFP going on a [killing spree](https://youtu.be/OSTDpEo7_D4?t=187) with Rampage x 2, the tier where you need 10 pellets to kill (i.e. a Dust Rock Blues pellet count). If you're going to two-tap basically no matter what, I'd rather have Opening Shot to increase the chance more of my pellets hit. Even DFP says, "Using a Rapid-Fire shotgun you're going to have to double-tap most people."
2. I prefer to use Icarus Grip in my mod slot. That doesn't negate the power of Rampage in general but if you're not going to run Rampage Spec, that's even less of a reason to consider running Rampage.

Based on the YouTube content creator hive mind, I'm in the minority on this opinion. It's easy to farm; be your own judge :)
* **(PvP) Aztecross Collector's Edition 🌶 (0.2% chance)**: Alright, here's a spicy take. Firmly Planted works while sliding and increases Accuracy **specifically**, not indirectly via Range. We discussed Opening Shot above and how I value hitting more pellets all the time versus doing a negligible additional amount of damage when Rampage is active, some of the time. This is the first roll that [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) uses in his video review (among others). It cleans up!

## Perfect Paradox - PvE
There's a good bit of [cargo-culting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting) when it comes to shotgun "God Rolls" and while I don't think there's any outright awful damage perks here, I do think you're better off with some than with others. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) is a good balance of science and excitement in terms of roll knowledge, so check it out; he's one of the rare folks to see the value in the criminally underrated Firmly Planted on shotguns.

There are a ton of damage-boosting perks on Perfect Paradox! We have Swashbuckler, One-Two Punch, Trench Barrel and Rampage. Let's go!
* **One-Two Punch**: If you're going to be using One-Two, you're better off with a high(er) impact shotgun. Your flow is shoot-punch-punch-shoot-... and with a Rapid Fire frame, your "shoot" is doing very little damage, comparatively. The perk is solid, but not on this frame IMHO.
* **Trench Barrel**: Post-Warmind, Trench Barrel took it on the chin. It was limited to a few seconds or three shots. Given that Bungie has never gone back on a nerf, feel free to pick one of these up for posterity but it's not all that great. It's kind of like the reverse One-Two Punch. Your flow is punch-shoot-shoot-shoot-punch-... so it's better for large(r) add clear but if you're dealing with larger adds/bosses you're getting stomped away so yeah, it's fine but not anyone's go-to at the moment.
* **Rampage**: Solid! Not much to say here; same as it ever was. Throw a Rampage Spec mod on to extend the duration by 1s.
* **Swashbuckler**: I prefer Swashbuckler here because it lasts as long as Rampage + Rampage Spec and you can shortcut the with a melee to Swash x 5.

BONUS! From Ehroar, a pretty slick [Infinite Ammo Perfect Paradox Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqw1OEGVl0)!

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvP
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky Straight-Up Recoil (0.3% chance)**: We're looking to max Stability and Range after maxing recoil. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are gravy.

* **(PvP) Super Picky Max Range (1.3% chance)**: Most of our stability will come from Firmly Planted so lets use the barrels and magazines to push out the range.
  ```

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvE
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvE) Super Picky (10.1% chance)**: How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range and Stability as possible?
  ```
  Barrels [ 91%]: Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvP
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (?!) as well as a combo of Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger, which is a rare combo.  Keep in mind TJ5 doesn't benefit from from the Season 9 R92 additional perk in the last slot, so these rolls are *tough* to get. Recently, True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08) and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls.
* **(PvP) "Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be" 🦹‍♂️ (0.4% chance)**: With an `84` base Stability and two Stability perks in the third and fourth columns, let's focus on increasing Range (not at the cost of Stability).
  ```
  Barrels [ 93%]: Quickdot SAS, Control SAS, Tactic SAS, Shortspec SAS
  Mags    [ 64%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvE
These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Disruption Break, who knew? CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks like Barrier can be applied to sidearms and since Barrier is a shield, Disruption Break will be great to pair with it. If you don't use Disruption Break, you're better off using another Energy weapon with damage-increasing perks.
* **(PvE) Super Picky Shieldbreaker (0.4% chance)**: That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk! We're adding ALH because to use Disruption Break you need to switch to your Kinetic weapon, which means ALH will proc and TJ5 will be reloaded and ready to go.

## Trophy Hunter - PvP
More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the  Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon. I toyed with not even having rolls here but it's easy to farm and only here this season; why not grab a decent roll?
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" 🐲 (0.8% chance)**: Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it doesn't feel so sluggish.

## Trophy Hunter - PvE
CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated). Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance. You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo of the barrel perk and Masterwork.
* **(PvE) "Triple Tap Your Way to Seven" (0.8% chance)**: That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here to be able to do that.

## Black Scorpion-4sr - PvP
[CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive  Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns). There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92 extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along the way.
* Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
* All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."
* The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range, but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a heck of a lot of Stability."
* Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your base Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
* No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not make-or-break.

Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).
* **(PvP) Mercules Collector's Edition 💪⭐️ (0.1% chance)**: Let's call this the "Mercules" roll, since listening to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`. Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance of this roll is... slim.

## Bygones - PvP
You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because, well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Just recently CoolGuy  [updated his prior review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMBASjJDwQ) of Bygones and those thoughts have been incorporated in to the rolls below.

Why bother with Bygones in 2020? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault!

Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls:

* Consider using a +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get the Recoil to 94 which is nearly vertical with a slightly left pull. Arrowhead Brake will get us to 99 Recoile without a CB mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range benefits of those other barrels. That being said, it would free up your mod slot for something like Targeting Adjuster or Rampage Spec.
* Handling is solid, among the highest of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this.
* With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range, precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off before Slideshot dissipates.
* I am requiring Kill Clip because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.

If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE). He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW.
* **(PvP) CoolGuy "Perfected" Collector's Edition 😎 (0.1% chance)**: CoolGuy: "This is a safe bet. It's a roll you'll be able to pull out a year from now and do well with." Arrowhead Brake means your recoil is at 99 and you can skip the Countbalance mod.

The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it, so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

## Bygones - PvE
The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal.

Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault.
We're going for sustained DPS and maximum range. Stability is already high enough and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage Spec mod on it!
* **(PvE) Super Picky (1.1% chance)**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.
  ```
  Barrels [ 72%]: Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

## Last Perdition - PvP / PvE
A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. Lots of resources for this one, including the [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/) [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns). I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and Mercules904 quite a bit in here.
* KK: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more Stability."
* KK: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you feel recoil too much"
* M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"
* M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo. If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
* CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more sluggish. Zen Moment is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is super high at 66.

For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition! Here he is on PC -  ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) - and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the  Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."
* **(PvP/PvE) Absurdly Picky (0.8% chance)**: This will be our generally acceptable classic set of Pulse Rifle rolls.

## Last Perdition - PvE
When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool. It's basically an Energy-slot Bygones-equivalent, so the rolls will be similar. We're going for as much sustained damage output and as much range as we can get. The key difference(s) will be that SUROS weapons have scopes and a different set of magazine options. Yes these are a narrow set of rolls but there's so much competition for the Energy slot you need something spicy to make the cut.
Some PvE rolls are mentioned above in the PvP set, because the perks overlap. I've labelled them PvP/PvE where appropriate.
* **(PvE) Baseline / Future-Proofing (4.8% chance)**: If you need a solid Pulse Rifle in your Energy slot, by all means this roll will do work. This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a standard DPS roll.
