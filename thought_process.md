# Welcome to the Sliflist!
This document is generated from a custom Destiny Item Manager "wishlist" and was
created on `2020-06-17 04:15:16 +00:00`. The most recent
version of this document can always be found [here](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/).

These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important.
This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide
on a roll yourself. For example Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are
`Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the
list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails,
those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random
kinetic Auto Rifle.

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't)
that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM
"Wishlist Notes" section (searchable in DIM via `wishlistnotes:`), when it could
do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your
own discretion.

**Some rolls are missing PvE or PvP sections. What gives?** If that's the case,
I'm of the opinion it's not worth chasing ツ

## Breachlight - PvP
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal, it's just another two-burst sidearm. You may as well use a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger, which has one of the lowest TTKs in all of Destiny.
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥 (0.2% chance)**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 25%]: Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Threat Detector
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Vorpal
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥(Minus Accurized) (0.8% chance)**: With a Range Masterwork, you can make up for not having Accurized
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [100%]: *
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Threat Detector
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Vorpal
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥(Minus Range MW) (0.8% chance)**: With Accurized, we're not as worried about the Range Masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 25%]: Accurized Rounds

  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Vorpal
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥(Minus Threat) (1.2% chance)**: While Threat Detector is solid, missing it doesn't change how amazing this roll would otherwise be.
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 25%]: Accurized Rounds

## Breachlight - PvE
Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below. You won't see obviously good rolls here (e.g. Outlaw + MKC) because the combination is so straightforward and easy to roll. I.e. you don't need to come to a DIM wishlist to tell you that these perks pair well togther :)
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger (3.0% chance)**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake. The lack of a Range Masterwork, or any specific Masterwork doesn't make or break this roll so I'm leaving it out.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Outlaw
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Multikill Clip
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloader (5.4% chance)**: Once you get on a tear, the damage perks will recharge your grenade quickly and by throwing it, you'll reload the mag. Rinse and repeat. This is especially spicy when paired with Devour-lock.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 60%]: Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Master of the Void (3.0% chance)**: Pair with Devour-lock and Nezarac's sin and you'll be flush with health, grenades and ability energy.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Osmosis
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky (Mini)Boss Shredder (4.5% chance)**: With a Major or Boss spec, Breachlight surprisingly wrecks. Throw this on in Sundial and watch what happens to Champions and Bosses.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell

  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Vorpal
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
## Gallant Charge - PvP
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time. There's not too many rolls here because it's not really worth running unless you get enough stat differentiation to make it more valuable than your dozens of alternatives in this crowded Energy slot.
* **(PvP) Fallout Stabile Zapper Collector's Edition ✨ (1.3% chance)**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    [ 33%]: Particle Repeater
  Perks 1 [100%]: *
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Tap the Trigger

## Gallant Charge - PvE
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon). The important perks are your third and fourth column for these rolls, so really any of them are fine.
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS (2.1% chance)**: How can we maximize damage uptime and bolt hits while minimizing falloff?
  ```
  Barrels [ 72%]: Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    [ 60%]: Projection Fuse, Ionized Battery

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvP
CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK. They're the only ones he feels are not currently competitive. Given that they used to be the best frames in D1 (remember Hawksaw?), file one away for a future date.
* **(PvP) "CoolGuy's Middle Child" Collector's Edition (0.0% chance)**: In the video above, CoolGuy makes a strong case for some buffs to this "middle" archetype of Pulse Rifle. "On console, Zen Moment and Eye of the Storm are great but you're going to get more utility from Zen Moment." We'll add EotS in later as a fallback.
  ```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Chambered Compensator

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvE
Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available? "It performs as expected. Great for mid- and low-tier adds. It does really well."

These rolls are just north of 2% because of the number of perks in the final two columns `(0.16 * 0.16 = 0.02)`, and the fact that they don't benefit from the Season 9 Rank 92 bonus of an additional perk in the final column.
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon 🐉 (2.2% chance)**: This is the one of the few weapons in the game that can roll with Demolitionist + Dragonfly. Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist.
  ```
  Barrels [100%]: *
  Mags    [ 78%]: Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Drop Mag, Alloy Magazine
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Dragonfly

  ```
* **(PvE) Punchy 👊 (2.2% chance)**: Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. 👊PUNCH AWAY!👊

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvP
This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons and the only other Energy HCs apart from Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u) with `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling! For analysis and gameplay, check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and medium range one is about half a meter". Yes for falloff that's true, but since Range affects stickyness, it's still got value here. For some of us (myself included), [CoolGuy's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5CjuOonRc) on the JKQ3 might be more up your alley, PvP-wise: "For Crucible it isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s kind of an acquired taste." It's never clicked with me but some people absolutely love it. IMHO similar to Sunshot - it's great on paper but the model is so chunky that it obscures where you're aiming when it kicks up. Its stiff competition and model/kick funkyness are why these rolls are so narrow. It needs a lot to compete with Luna's, Not Forgotten and Waking Vigil (which can be farmed from Menagerie with a predetermined Masterwork). The second set of these rolls is meant to be slightly more forgiving if you really want Demo and/or Snapshot.
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (0.1% chance)**: Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get  this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much Stability and Handling as we can get.
  ```

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvE
[Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ): "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and  Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns. CoolGuy has a [great set of rolls](https://youtu.be/XI5CjuOonRc?t=463) I'm incorporating here as well. "Very stout PvE hand cannon; top-tier."
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky) (2.0% chance)**: Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't forget Dragonfly Spec! Per CoolGuy, this is a rarely available combo; pick it up.

## Line in the Sand - PvP
Ages ago, Fallout put out a [Crooked Fang God Roll video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB-s1IYDpeQ) and lo' and behold, Line in the Sand is basically an Arc Crooked Fang! So let's get to taking their command out one by... We can rely on that review for some solid tips. Is it a PvP workhorse? Nah but fun is fun so if you like LFRs, go nuts.

## Line in the Sand - PvE
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
* **(PvE) Super Picky DPS (0.3% chance)**: The full suite of perks to maximize DPS on a big ol' target. We're looking for some Stability-enhancing barrels as well.

## Martyr's Retribution - PvP
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for Reload and Velocity in that order. The base Velocity @ `86` and Reload @ `77` (thanks to `High-Velocity Rounds` being one of two fixed barrels) seems more than good enough, so lets focus on Reload and Handling. I don't require Demolitionist because like Fighting Lion, I see Martyr's more as a starter than a finisher. By all means, roll with it, but I'm more excited about the perks below because I think we'll get more consistent utility from them. With breach-load launchers, we're going to run `Quick Access Sling`, which buffs swapping speed and since the Martyr's Handling stat is already so high, I don't think we need too much more Handling here. Let's look for Velocity-based barrels and since there's only two available magazines, that choice is easy ;)
* **(PvP) Super Picky (1.5% chance)**: Elemental Capacitor's +Reload and +Handling buffs (Solar and Arc respectively) are pheneomenal attributes to bump on breach load launchers.
  ```
  Barrels [ 95%]: Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    [100%]: *
  Perks 1 [ 20%]: Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 [ 40%]: Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  [ 20%]: Reload MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Capacitor) (3.8% chance)**: Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor. It helps but it's totally optional.
  ```
  Barrels [ 95%]: Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch

  Perks 1 [ 20%]: Auto-Loading Holster

  MWorks  [ 20%]: Reload MW
  ```
## Martyr's Retribution - PvE
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker (5.3% chance)**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...
  ```
  Barrels [ 95%]: Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    [100%]: *
  Perks 1 [ 20%]: Genesis
  Perks 2 [ 70%]: Demolitionist, Lead from Gold
  MWorks  [ 40%]: Reload MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) The Instant Reloader (10.7% chance)**: We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly?
  ```
  Barrels [ 95%]: Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    [100%]: *
  Perks 1 [ 40%]: Auto-Loading Holster, Threat Detector
  Perks 2 [ 70%]: Demolitionist, Lead from Gold

## Patron of Lost Causes - PvP / PvE
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). Since this is a controller wishlist, these rolls are all about maxing Stability. All of these PvP rolls would be perfectly fine rolls in PvE as well.
* **(PvP/PvE) "Rapid Hitstability" (1.6% chance)**: This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling

  Perks 2 [ 60%]: Explosive Rounds, Vorpal
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvP/PvE) Rapid Rangestability (1.4% chance)**: Maybe even though you're on controller, you like your Stability with a side of Range? Listen, I'm not the boss of you. Range barrels are a great option with this roll as well, but I think, less desirable hence their place in the batting order.

## Perfect Paradox - PvP
Rapid-fire frames in PvP are a different breed. They're not like Aggressive or Precision Frames for the spicy, consistent one-hit kills. If you want something like that in this slot, you want to farm Menagerie for [Dust Rock Blues](https://www.light.gg/db/items/636912560/dust-rock-blues/) or even [Toil and Trouble](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2957367743/toil-and-trouble/).

The big debate here will be Opening Shot or Rampage. Many folks, like Sheikh (aka [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEmXDccobw)) prefer Rampage + Rampage Spec in the final slot. I don't and here's why:

1. Rapid-fire frames require 12 pellets to kill. Each tier of Rampage decreases the number of pellets needed by one. Here's DFP going on a [killing spree](https://youtu.be/OSTDpEo7_D4?t=187) with Rampage x 2, the tier where you need 10 pellets to kill (i.e. a Dust Rock Blues pellet count). If you're going to two-tap basically no matter what, I'd rather have Opening Shot to increase the chance more of my pellets hit. Even DFP says, "Using a Rapid-Fire shotgun you're going to have to double-tap most people."
2. I prefer to use Icarus Grip in my mod slot. That doesn't negate the power of Rampage in general but if you're not going to run Rampage Spec, that's even less of a reason to consider running Rampage.

Based on the YouTube content creator hive mind, I'm in the minority on this opinion. It's easy to farm; be your own judge :)
* **(PvP) Aztecross Collector's Edition 🌶 (0.2% chance)**: Alright, here's a spicy take. Firmly Planted works while sliding and increases Accuracy **specifically**, not indirectly via Range. We discussed Opening Shot above and how I value hitting more pellets all the time versus doing a negligible additional amount of damage when Rampage is active, some of the time. This is the first roll that [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) uses in his video review (among others). It cleans up!

## Perfect Paradox - PvE
There's a good bit of [cargo-culting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting) when it comes to shotgun "God Rolls" and while I don't think there's any outright awful damage perks here, I do think you're better off with some than with others. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) is a good balance of science and excitement in terms of roll knowledge, so check it out; he's one of the rare folks to see the value in the criminally underrated Firmly Planted on shotguns.

There are a ton of damage-boosting perks on Perfect Paradox! We have Swashbuckler, One-Two Punch, Trench Barrel and Rampage. Let's go!
* **One-Two Punch**: If you're going to be using One-Two, you're better off with a high(er) impact shotgun. Your flow is shoot-punch-punch-shoot-... and with a Rapid Fire frame, your "shoot" is doing very little damage, comparatively. The perk is solid, but not on this frame IMHO.
* **Trench Barrel**: Post-Warmind, Trench Barrel took it on the chin. It was limited to a few seconds or three shots. Given that Bungie has never gone back on a nerf, feel free to pick one of these up for posterity but it's not all that great. It's kind of like the reverse One-Two Punch. Your flow is punch-shoot-shoot-shoot-punch-... so it's better for large(r) add clear but if you're dealing with larger adds/bosses you're getting stomped away so yeah, it's fine but not anyone's go-to at the moment.
* **Rampage**: Solid! Not much to say here; same as it ever was. Throw a Rampage Spec mod on to extend the duration by 1s.
* **Swashbuckler**: I prefer Swashbuckler here because it lasts as long as Rampage + Rampage Spec and you can shortcut the with a melee to Swash x 5.

BONUS! From Ehroar, a pretty slick [Infinite Ammo Perfect Paradox Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqw1OEGVl0)!

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvP
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky Straight-Up Recoil (0.3% chance)**: We're looking to max Stability and Range after maxing recoil. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are gravy.

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvE
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvP
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (?!) as well as a combo of Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger, which is a rare combo.  Keep in mind TJ5 doesn't benefit from from the Season 9 R92 additional perk in the last slot, so these rolls are *tough* to get. Recently, True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08) and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls.
* **(PvP) "Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be" 🦹‍♂️ (0.4% chance)**: With an `84` base Stability and two Stability perks in the third and fourth columns, let's focus on increasing Range (not at the cost of Stability).

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvE
These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Disruption Break, who knew? CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks like Barrier can be applied to sidearms and since Barrier is a shield, Disruption Break will be great to pair with it. If you don't use Disruption Break, you're better off using another Energy weapon with damage-increasing perks.
* **(PvE) Super Picky Shieldbreaker (0.4% chance)**: That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk! We're adding ALH because to use Disruption Break you need to switch to your Kinetic weapon, which means ALH will proc and TJ5 will be reloaded and ready to go.
  ```

## Trophy Hunter - PvP
More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the  Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon. I toyed with not even having rolls here but it's easy to farm and only here this season; why not grab a decent roll?
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" 🐲 (0.8% chance)**: Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it doesn't feel so sluggish.
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel
  Mags    [ 85%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Alloy Magazine, Flared Magwell

  ```
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Relaxed Pulse) 🐲 (3.1% chance)**: Same as the above, minus `Pulse Monitor` which really is not a big deal in the first place, but neat to have if you're burning through Fractaline for these rolls.
  ```

* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Relaxed Barrels) 🐲 (4.9% chance)**: Same as the above, with a more permissive set of barrels expanded to anything that doesn't reduce Handling.
  ```

## Trophy Hunter - PvE
CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated). Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance. You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo of the barrel perk and Masterwork.
* **(PvE) "Triple Tap Your Way to Seven" (0.8% chance)**: That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here to be able to do that.
  ```
  Barrels [ 91%]: Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

* **(PvE) Gambit Shieldbreaker (1.4% chance)**: Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.

## Seventh Seraph Carbine - PvP
The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s, over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3). In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist mod. 

Should you pick one up for use in Season 10? In Season 10, 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Auto Rifles are the meta (e.g. SUROS Regime, Monte Carlo, Hard Light). There's no pressing reason to chase SSC rolls for PvP.

I personally love ARs, so I played with a [zero-Recoil, high Stability](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/DY2Aqw8sOokyOvhv0Wv1Ehw9zBP2FwQRxW2Ig9KX1MIo3LEpW) roll for several Iron Banner games, with both Enhanced Targeting and Enhanced Unflinching. I immediately wanted to go back to using my Arc Logic with Moving Target and Tap the Trigger :) The SSC is definitely a bit slower than you'd prefer (as are all 450 RPMs, even the vaunted Uriel's Gift these days). 

That being said, if you enjoy Destiny's National Pasttime of shredding supers in sixes, a Vorpal-rolled SSC could be for you! If you're a fan of ARs or even just the SSC itself, why not pick one up and vault it just in case the meta changes? Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* The lower the RPM the higher the range, and falloff for a base range SSC starts ~30m which is quite far in-game; probably at the maximum range you'd choose to engage with an Auto Rifle anyway.
* I'm passing on `Threat Detector` because at that engagement range of 15m, you're going to feel like switching to your special weapon.
* With a base `Recoil` of `74`, you're fine there. I shot a few magazines into a wall with `100` and the pattern was the same. Do not put on a `Counterbalance` mod or else you'll ruin the recoil pattern. 
* I don't have any rolls featuring `Elemental Capacitor` because at some point you hit diminishing returns on all this `Stability`. I pivot around `Moving Target` because it's not something that many Auto Rifles can roll and it makes it far more lethal by directly addressing target acquisition.

Here's a few rolls worth considering that you can put to work today!
* **(PvP) Slif's "Pristine, Picture-Perfect Auto Rifle" 🧼📸 Collector's Edition (0.0% chance)**: This is my pristine, picture-perfect Auto Rifle roll. There's less than a 0.1% chance you get this, so if you do please buy us both a lottery ticket.

## Seventh Seraph Carbine - PvE
For its base stats and perks, there isn't a whole lot of reason to consider the SSC for PvE. While it does feature Swashbuckler and Rampage, it doesn't combine it with a reload-boosting perk like Feeding Frenzy or Outlaw. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon with the unique perk `Onslaught` is also 450 RPM and recently received a buff in Season 10. It shreds in PvE and since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10 Artifact mods.
Still, there's at least a couple of reasons why you might want to consider a SSC.
1. It's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.
1. It can roll with `Fourth Time's the Charm` and `Vorpal` together, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take Overload mods. In the future things will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier too. The mag seems endless when dumping in to Champions and bosses; kinda cool :)
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊 (2.8% chance)**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. FTTC and Vorpal make the roll; without both you may as well use another Vorpal weapon. Based on the past two seasons, they won't be hard to come by :)

## Seventh Seraph CQC-12 - PvP
The CQC-12 is an 80 RPM "Lightweight Frame" shotgun in the energy slot. Through leveling the season pass, you unlock a chance for it to drop at the conclusion of Gambit, Crucible and Strike activities. You can't really "farm" it per se. The good news is that there's only four perks in the final two columns meaning it's not incredibly difficult to get the perks you might be interested in. See how it compares to other randomly-rolled 80 RPMs over on  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BslVBs;CEKlVP;Brud8B;DmKQYw). Statistically, they're all quite similar and like all shotguns, otherwise identical in barrels and magazines.

Three reasons why the CQC is exciting for PvP:

* Where the CQC-12 stands out from its kin is that it can roll with the vaunted Quickdraw + Snapshot pairing. No other 80 RPM shotgun can do this. Here's  [the list](https://www.light.gg/god-roll/?f=2,10\(Shotgun\),28:0\(706527188;957782887\)) of shotguns that can. Perhaps as a drawback however, it cannot roll with Opening Shot or Moving Target.
* It can roll with Vorpal which means it can two-shot any super in PvP. If you'd like a little footage of DFP slaying with Vorpal (and an otherwise) near perfect roll, [here you go](https://youtu.be/30b4t1XZdi0?t=110).
* It looks and sounds *amazing*, and that's like 80% of the reason to use a weapon :)

Our first couple of roll sets will be classic shotgun rolls and the third will feature Vorpal; currently the only shotgun that can roll it!

## Seventh Seraph CQC-12 - PvE
This section will be straightforward :) All of our rolls are toing to be centered around Trench Barrel. It provides a 50% damage boost vs. Vorpal's 15%. Trench Barrel takes a melee to activate, but with shotguns you have to be in melee range anyway, so you're good!

This isn't a "run and gun" shotgun. There are no damage-boosting perks, like Swashbuckler or Rampage, you have Slideshot and Auto-Loading Holster but so do plenty of other shotguns.
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊Collector's Edition (1.3% chance)**: We're basing these next few rolls around Trench Barrel. Quickdraw will help with swapping from the hits between Trench Barrel activations.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvP
The Officer Revolver is a 180 RPM Kinetic Hand Cannon. See how it compares to other 180 RPM Hand Cannons over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C1DOIY;xtxS0;DzBRNi) Let's start off with Mercules and Kyt from the latest Massive Breakdown podcast. Turns out they [aren't super hot](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown#t=33:44) on the Officer's Revolver.

> **Mercules:** *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon except for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil then the Officer's. Statistically, Officer's is not a super impressive hand cannon."*

Personally I think that's overstating things. The Service Revolver isn't **that** much different in terms of base stats. Trust is clearly better but not insanely-so. That being said, it's a 180 and the 180s haven't been part of the PvP meta in quite a while. If they were any stonger they'd be three-tapping and that would make them far too strong. I agree with Mercules' position that given how easy they are to use, they have a balanced TTK.


Now let's check out [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM), who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM) wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.
> **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes it special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not the best stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those stats available on a 180."*

Vorpal and Timed Payload are uniquely available on the Officer Revolver. I personally love Vorpal in PvP and love the idea of Timed Payload, but I've always liked variety more than than the objective, optimal meta. If that partially describes you and you're interested in bagging a few PvP rolls, read on!
> **Drewsky:** *"Prioritizing Range while giving the best oveall stat package possible."*

I only partially agree with Drewsky here. Going back to our understanding of the new compressed range on Hand Cannons, we can cite some science from CoolGuy: "(35 Range = 25m falloff, 86 Range = 28m)". I'm not sure I'd want to blow valuable Magazine and Barrel slots for one to three meters of falloff.

The good news is that the wishlist can support multiple perspectives! I'll put together a set of Range-prioritizing rolls representing Drewsky's perspective, and a set of Handling/Stability prioritizing rolls. There is no "baseline" roll for the Officer Revolver because the baseline stats aren't what make this weapon interesting. There are plenty of other 140s and 150s that you'd prioritize over this if you were just looking for a workhorse PvP Hand Cannon.
* **(PvP) Drewsky's "Planted Range" 🏔🌱🏔🌱🏔🌱Collector's Edition (0.1% chance)**: *"Timed Payload?! That's supposed to be positively horrible. Doesn't it lower your TTK?"* Well, it causes double the flinch and the explosion has no range falloff. On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload shouldn't lower the TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the math) as you would be getting the kill on the last bullet and not on the last 17 damage from Timed Payload. Vorpal is great for shredding supers.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvE
There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my preferred.

"OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"
1. Most importantly, it's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.
1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods I'm sure).

"Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊 (2.8% chance)**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics. **WARNING**: It's possible that a PvP roll without a preference in the FTTC column will "take" this roll. Bear in mind that might have this roll and it would be lit up as a PvP roll.

## Seventh Seraph SAW - PvP
Drewsky has a great review of the [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0), another 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun. From the review, it hits for 48 crit / 38 body (TTK 0.5s / 0.83s). It's got terrific range and flinches like crazy.

That being said, it's still a Machine Gun which tends not to be the pick for PvP... BUT... BUT! The SAW can roll with `Opening Shot` in the final column. Because the rate of fire is so low, you can single tap out shots and get crits across the map. Try out some Machine Gun sniping in Mayhem and let me know how that works out for you 🎯

Otherwise, there's no pressing reason to farm for a SAW for PvP, at least none moreso than any other Machine Gun.
* **(PvP) Slif's "Sniper MG" 🎯 Collector's Edition (0.5% chance)**: Any basic roll will chew up Guardians with a lot of flinch. Let's add `Range` and `Stability` where we can, while seeing what `Opening Shot` can do.

## Seventh Seraph SAW - PvE
The SAW is 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun and is an absolute monster in PvE. *"But Slif, everyone says Machine Guns are crap for DPS so why do you even have a PvE section?!?"*

Walk with me, grasshopper.

This is going to be a long one because I haven't found any super detailed coverage of the SAW (or any other Seraph weapon save for the Hand Cannon). Fortunately since a High-Impact is a High-Impact (at base), Drewsky has a great review of the [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0) that's definitely worth watching! The SAW can't roll with most of the perks he discussed in that video, but it's still super solid at its base.

* It's a Seraph weapon which means it generates Warmind Cells if you have Warmind mods equipped (Season 10).
* As a High-Impact Frame, the SAW keeps anything it doesn't kill practically stun-locked. As the difficulty of PvE content increases, this becomes super important. Even if you're not doing Grandmaster Nightfalls, flinching challenging adds sure makes things more straightforward. Keeping the bosses flinched as they march towards your plate during a Seraph Tower event comes in handy!
* Its base effecive `Range` is amazing. Damage falloff starts ~45m and is reasonable up to ~50m (-5%). You're talking maximum damage at Scout Rifle ranges. At maximum range, the sight overlaps your target because MGs don't have high-zoom sights/scopes. *This is why I'm not suggesting any `Range` boosting below - when I pushed the `Range` to `93` falloff and floors were unchanged and the recoil/handling will make it challenging to stay on target anyway.*
* It's the only Machine Gun that can roll with `Vorpal` or `Firing Line` in the final column, which provide 15% and 25% damage boosts, respectively. Those are substantial increases to damage without requiring a kill or reload to activate. 

If you're still not bought in, that's cool 😀👋. If you're still here, let's get those rolls! In order of importance:

* Column 3:
  * ✅`Field Prep` is far and away the winner. It grants a whopping 25%
  more in reserve (223 to 278), speeds up your reload time by two seconds
  (~5.5s to ~3.5s) and increases ready and stow speed. For PvE, nothing
  else comes close. By the way, within 45m at 1,222 to 1,716 damage,
  that's an extra 67k - 94k damage available to you.

  * ❌`Auto-Loading Holster` and `Grave Robber` are the other two reload
  perks in this column and neither is worth giving up the reserve and
  handling bonuses that `Field Prep` provides.

* Column 4:
  * ✅`Firing Line`: 25% damage boost when near two teammates. In
PvE content you're nearly always with your fireteam: Strikes, Raids, Menagerie, Vex Offensive, Sundial, Seraph Towers... I'm comfortable reccomending `Firing Line` in general. It has double utility in dealing with adds and on boss DPS. Granted it's not your go-to for boss damage but since you already have it equipped for adds and Champions, may as well have something to do with all this ammo when you're on the boss!

  * ✅`Vorpal`: 15% damage boost to yellow bars and Champions. It's
a solid pick if you don't have one with `Firing Line`.

  * ❌`Mulligan`: Nope. You shouldn't be missing many shots and the
opportunity cost of Mulligan is too high. At maximum range on the Tribute Hall Ogre, I was hitting at least 50% crits at the base `Recoil` and no `Stability` boosts.

  * ❌`Opening Shot`: This is interesting because at 360 RPM you can tap
out one bullet at a time, turning this in to kind of an incredibly high-impact Scout Rifle. Situationally cool but you can still use the SAW like this just fine without it. Arguably more of an off-meta PvP pick.

  * ❌`Elemental Capacitor`: While large, the effect of any of these
increases pales in comparison to significantly higher damage output. You can also get each of the benefits through other perks or armor mods. This isn't a case in general against `Capacitor`, just on this particular weapon.

  * ❌`Disruption Break`: A 50% Kinetic damage bonus debuff is nothing to
sneeze at! This is a niche pick for when you're up against Arc shields because in a Match Game activity, you won't do enough damage to break non-matching shields. Myself, if I'm hopping in to a difficult PvE activity I'm going to get more general, always-on use from Firing Line.
Otherwise we're shooing for higher Stability
* **(PvE) Slif's "Together Forever" 🤝♬ Collector's Edition (0.6% chance)**: With other Guardians at your side, you will rip through hordes of aliens no problem. We're taking any Barrel that increases Stability and magazine-extended... Magazines. Extended Magazine would normally be a hot mess with a base `Reload` so low, but with Field Prep it only takes the reload from ~3.5s to ~4.5s (still 1s shorter than the base `Reload`).

## Seventh Seraph SI-2 - PvP
The SI-2 is the 2020 version of the Anonymous Autumn (Kyt: *"which is the best-in-class for lightweight sidearms"*) and is the only other randomly rolled 360 RPM Energy sidearm. Mercules is on the same page: *"It (SI-2) doesn't have great Stability or great Range. I would pick a well-rolled Anonymous Autumn over this every time."* Why do they say that? It's got basically the same stats as an Anonymous Autumn but has 33% less Range and 20% less Stability. On the plus side the SI-2 has 7% better Handling (64 > 69) 🙃

Even TrueVanguard, who absolutely loves the Anonymous Autumn (with over 14,000 kills) depicts the SI-2 as situational, relying primarily on Vorpal to justify using it. Check out [his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCtP2PjAEgY).

If you are going to consider the SI-2 for PvP, a few things to keep in mind:
* The recoil direction is 95, so no need to worry about straightening it out. I.e. the +Recoil barrels shouldn't be your first pick. Instead, focus on Range and Stability.
* Full Auto is going to be a make-or-break perk for some, as many guardians have a love-it-or-hate-it relationsihp with single-shot sidearms. If that's your thing, know that no other perk in that column is a must-have. I find that 360s are unsuable for me without it, so I'll be picking one of these up to see how it plays with Vorpal. 

On to the rolls!
* **(PvP) Slif's "Full Auto Super Shredder" 💥Collector's Edition (0.9% chance)**: These rolls aren't super tight on the Barrel and Magazine front because they aren't going to dramatically alter the value of the overall roll. Vorpal is really the key here. Without Vorpal, you're better off using the better-rolled Anonymous Autumn as mentioned above. Otherwise we're going for +Range and +Stability wherever we can get it.

## Seventh Seraph SI-2 - PvE
Like all other Seraph weapons, the SI-2 contributes to the generation of Warmind cells in PvE. If that's not your thing, you can pretty much pass on this weapon full stop. Since it can roll with Dragonfly, it could have made beautiful music with the `Wrath of Rasputin` Warmind mod: `Solar splash damage final blows have a chance to create Warmind Cells`. Unfortunately the SI-2 is a Void weapon 👿

That being said, there are a few combos that could prove interesting for the discerning collector / sidearm aficionado.
* **(PvE) "Sparks Flying" 🎇 (2.8% chance)**: The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod from Ada-1!

## Seventh Seraph VY-7 - PvP
The VY-7 is a 600 RPM Energy "Precision Frame" SMG. Here's how it compares to all other randomly-rolled 600 RPM SMGs on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=trStZ;CYr9QP;CQZu7f;B9hF8b;). It's competitive base-stat-wise but there's a reason you've probably never been killed by any of these weapons (or any SMG for that matter) since the first year of Destiny 2. In Season 10 with the recent Adaptive Auto Rifle buff, Auto Rifles outclass SMGs and failing ARs, both sidearms and shotguns are going to frustrate the hell out of you.

Forget it right? But do you remember this world?

* [Antiope-D's FINAL FORM! (God Roll)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxnkTvtuXEA) - Destiny Fun Police
* [The Perfect Antiope-D does exist!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3tC-IkkFRU) - CammyCakes
* [Antiope-D and Sniping = New Meta ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjG32gyUh_w) - ZkMushroom

The VY-7 is an Energy Antiope-D (the basic stat variances are immaterial in practice). Yes it's not the meta now, but a solid roll might be worth throwing in the vault.

"Why don't any of these rolls value `Range`?" The difference between the base range of `59` and let's say `80` (using Accurized Rounds, etc.) buys you about a whopping one meter of falloff (~16 to ~17m). I don't value buffing Range all that highly on the VY-7. It's not that it's *bad* per se, it's just that the opportunity cost is high.
* **(PvP) Slif's "Weird Auto Rifle but OK" 🤷‍♂️🌱 Collector's Edition (0.7% chance)**: We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so we can go for Stability-enhancing Barrel options. Wait, what the hell is `Elemental Capacitor` doing in there?! The Handling and Stability bonuses are material. The Stability bonus is the most noticeable,  [estimated](https://youtu.be/D_Mv-AdfYqM?t=36) to be around `20 points`. You *absolutely* feel the difference with `Elemental Capacitor` active (don't forget to swap weapons if you're testing it) so I won't be relaxing it on these rolls. I think there's not much of a point to this SMG above other Energy weapons unless you can flex what makes it unique, and `Elemental Capacitor` certainly does that.

## Seventh Seraph VY-7 - PvE
The VY-7 is the only SMG that's able to roll with Vorpal and you'll want one of these for two reasons:

* The VY-7 is a Seraph weapon and contributes to the generation of Warmind Cells.
* SMGs are eligible for certain Season 10 Artifact weapon mods.

...so let's come up with some rolls that help shred Champions and generate Warmind Cells (i.e. shred adds).

You must absolutely run a `Counterbalance` Mod or otherwise fix the Recoil with `Arrowhead Brake` or `Chambered Compensator`. Even though its base Recoil is `91` it's still a hot mess to control, esp. with its low Handling. For the rolls below I'm going to assume you're rolling with a `Counterbalance` Mod installed.
* **(PvE) "Champion Shredder" 🏆💥 Collector's Edition (0.7% chance)**: Whenever SMGs are up on the Artifact, you'll want Vorpal to help shred through Champions. FTTC might seem like a strange choice for an SMG but the rate of fire is so fast, you'd be surprised how often it you end up getting it to proc. I won't be relaxing either Vorpal or FTTC on these rolls because just one of either would mean that it's not worth using this over something else in the Energy slot.

## Black Scorpion-4sr - PvP
[CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive  Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns). There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92 extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along the way.
* Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
* All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."
* The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range, but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a heck of a lot of Stability."
* Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your base Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
* No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not make-or-break.

Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).
* **(PvP) Mercules Collector's Edition 💪⭐️ (0.1% chance)**: Let's call this the "Mercules" roll, since listening to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`. Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance of this roll is... slim.

## Bygones - PvP
You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because, well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Just recently CoolGuy  [updated his prior review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMBASjJDwQ) of Bygones and those thoughts have been incorporated in to the rolls below.

Why bother with Bygones in 2020? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault!

Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls:

* Consider using a +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get the Recoil to 94 which is nearly vertical with a slightly left pull. Arrowhead Brake will get us to 99 Recoile without a CB mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range benefits of those other barrels. That being said, it would free up your mod slot for something like Targeting Adjuster or Rampage Spec.
* Handling is solid, among the highest of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this.
* With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range, precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off before Slideshot dissipates.
* I am requiring Kill Clip because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.

If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE). He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW.
* **(PvP) CoolGuy "Perfected" Collector's Edition 😎 (0.1% chance)**: CoolGuy: "This is a safe bet. It's a roll you'll be able to pull out a year from now and do well with." Arrowhead Brake means your recoil is at 99 and you can skip the Countbalance mod.

## Bygones - PvE
The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal.

Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault.
We're going for sustained DPS and maximum range. Stability is already high enough and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage Spec mod on it!
* **(PvE) Super Picky (1.1% chance)**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.
  ```
  Barrels [ 72%]: Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

## Interference VI - PvE
Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time, so why record wishlist rolls for this? A couple of reasons:

* This reissued IVI can now roll Full Court. The only other GLs that can roll Full Court are `Doomsday` and `Love and Death`, both of which are capped at end of Season 11 (i.e. 1060PL). Full Court, at max range (> 50m) has a 25% damage increase. It's worth picking up!
* The perk pool is really small, with only four possibilities in the final two columns, which slightly offsets the number of perks in the first and second columns.

The Power weapon pool is so small that you're going to buried under mountains of these. Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll. Enjoy your New Monarchy Grenader Launcher! :)
* **(PvE) "From Dooowwwwntown" 🏀🏀🏀Collector's Edition (0.2% chance)**: If the stars align, you'll get one that bumps Velocity as high as possible.

## Last Perdition - PvP
A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. It was brought back in Season of the Drifter with random rolls, and it unfortunately kept a pretty baseline set of perks. There's so much magic happening in the Energy slot now that we're so deep into Destiny 2 that we're going to have a pretty high bar for rolls here.

Lots of resources for this one, including the [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/) [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns). I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and Mercules904 quite a bit in here.
* Kyt: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more Stability."
* Kyt: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you feel recoil too much"
* M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"
* M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo. If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
* CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more sluggish. `Zen Moment` is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is super high at 66, so we're going to prioritize that.

For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition! Here he is on PC -  ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) - and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the  Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."
* **(PvP) Absurdly Sticky 🍭🍭🍭Collector's Edition (0.8% chance)**: With `Moving Target` and `Zen Moment`, your weapon should only produce yellow numbers. We'd also be thrilled to get `Firmly Planted` here!

* **(PvP) Absurdly Planted 🌱Collector's Edition (0.8% chance)**: `Firmly Planted` is criminally underrated. It's a difference in playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be rewarded. We'll be getting so much `Stability` from `Firmly Planted` that we can relax our requirement for `Zen Moment`.

## Last Perdition - PvE
When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool from Destiny 2 Year 1. Not a ton of finesse here in the rolls we're looking for :)
* **(PvE) Baseline DPS (4.8% chance)**: There are so many amazing PvE weapons in the energy slot and this perk set is so dated that even with this combo, you may choose to use something else :)
