These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important. This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide on a roll yourself. E.g. Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails, those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random kinetic Auto Rifle :)

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't) that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM "Notes" section, when it could do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your own discretion.
## Breachlight (PvP)
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw, it's just another two-burst sidearm, which is great but you don't need a wishlist for that :)
* **(PvP) Slif's Super Picky**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
  ```
  Barrels : Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Threat Detector
  Perks 2 : Vorpal
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky**: Any roll in this set would give you an A+ PvP roll. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw in the final column, you're better off using a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger.
  ```
  Barrels : Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Threat Detector, Demolitionist, Outlaw
  Perks 2 : Vorpal, Quickdraw
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus MW and Accurized)**: Same as before, minus the Range MW and Accurized Rounds since you have only a 25% to get each of them. This is still an amazing roll.
  ```
  Barrels : Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Threat Detector, Demolitionist, Outlaw
  Perks 2 : Vorpal, Quickdraw
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Baseline**: You've got basically a 50% chance of getting this roll :) Yes it would be awesome to have +20 range from Accurized and a Range MW but it's still a great weapon.
  ```
  Barrels : Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : (Any perk)
  Perks 2 : Vorpal, Quickdraw
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Breachlight (PvE)
Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below.
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Outlaw
  Perks 2 : Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Basic Gunslinger**: Same as above, minus the magazine and masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Outlaw
  Perks 2 : Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloading Devour-lock**: With Devour on, you'll have your grenade constantly and since throwing your grenade reloads the weapon, you can keep `Rampage x 3` up for a long time.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloading Devour-lock (Minus Magazines)**: Same as above, minus Accurized Rounds since it's so much harder to get than Range MW.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloading Devour-lock (Minus Masterwork)**: Same as above, minus the Range MW
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Rarely-Reloading Bezerker**: With Drop Mag and a Reload MW, you'll be able to keep Rampage up. You could also do this with
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Drop Mag
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Basic Rarely-Reloading Bezerker**: Same as above, minus the Masterwork
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Drop Mag
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Master of the Void**: Pair with Devour-lock and Nezarac's sin and you'll be flush with health, grenades and ability energy.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Osmosis
  MWorks  : Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Basic Master of the Void**: Same as above with just the core perks.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Osmosis
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Gallant Charge (PvP)
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.
* **(PvP) Super Picky Stability**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!
  ```
  Barrels : Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    : Particle Repeater
  Perks 1 : (Any perk)

## Gallant Charge (PvE)
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon).
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS**: How can we maximize damage uptime and bolt hits while minimizing falloff?
  ```
  Barrels : Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    : Projection Fuse, Ionized Battery

## Infinite Paths 8 (PvP)
CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&feature=youtu.be&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK.
* **(PvP) Picky**: This roll focuses on addressing recoil and stability. Because it needs so much help, there isn't much room left for neat damage perks :)
  ```
  Barrels : Chambered Compensator
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Moving Target
  Perks 2 : Zen Moment
  MWorks  : Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Long-Distance Melee'r**: Useful for those subclasses with ranged melees. This is a fringe roll, one that I wouldn't throw away but not one that I'm racing to collect.
  ```
  Barrels : Chambered Compensator
  Mags    : Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 : Moving Target
  Perks 2 : Swashbuckler
  MWorks  : Stability MW
  ```
## Infinite Paths 8 (PvE)
Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available?
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon**: This is the only weapon in the game that has this perk combo available! Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist. It does work. Probably not your best Energy weapon but a fun one for shredding red bars. I would collect it and store it.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Demolitionist
  Perks 2 : Dragonfly
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Punchy ðŸ‘Š**: Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. ðŸ‘ŠPUNCH AWAY!ðŸ‘Š
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)

## Line in the Sand (PvE)
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
* **(PvE) Super Picky**: The full suite of perks to maximize DPS with LitS.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : Accelerated Coils
  Perks 1 : Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 : Firing Line
  MWorks  : Charge MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline**: Really, any roll with these two perks is Good Enough(tm).
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : (Any magazine)

## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for velocity, reload and handling wherever I can get it. The base Velocity is `76` and since the second column perks are fixed, that's a flat `+9` so we're at `84`. That seems more than good enough, so lets focus on reload + handling. There's only one roll here because it's not that hard to farm.
* **(PvP) Super Picky**: Threat Detector has such a long proc range that I'm going to put it on par with Auto-Loading Holster here. We can choose (or not choose) to use the reload and handling boosts on Elemental Capacitor, paired with the masterworks. Don't forget a `Quick Access Sling` mod!
  ```
  Barrels : Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Threat Detector, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 : Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  : Reload MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky**: Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor which is the hardest to get out of the other perks.
  ```
  Barrels : Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Threat Detector, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 : (Any perk)
  MWorks  : Reload MW, Handling MW
  ```
## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) The Instant Reloader**: We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly?
  ```
  Barrels : Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Auto-Loading Holster, Threat Detector, Field Prep
  Perks 2 : Demolitionist
  MWorks  : Reload MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...
  ```
  Barrels : Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Genesis
  Perks 2 : Demolitionist
  MWorks  : Reload MW, Handling MW

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls. Randy's is in the same slot and has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip already, so I'm not losing too much sleep about getting a perfect roll here.
* **(PvP) Super Picky**: This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better.
  ```
  Barrels : Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel
  Mags    : Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 : Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 : Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal
  MWorks  : Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Barrels)**: Same as above, minus the barrels
  ```

  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
This is the only Scout Rifle that can roll Vorpal or Osmosis. This isn't a high priority roll for you to go after and it's also pretty much the core components of the PvP rolls we have down already. With the S92 double-perk bonus, you should be able to get one of these pretty promptly :)
* **(PvE) Utility**: Future-proofing
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)

  Perks 1 : Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 : Osmosis, Vorpal
  MWorks  : (Any masterwork)

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky**: We're looking to max stability after maxing recoil, as much as we can. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are terrific of course, but without those two, we don't have enough control to matter.
  ```
  Barrels : Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    : Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 : Firmly Planted
  Perks 2 : Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  : Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Magazine and Perks)**: Same as above, minus mags and perks.
  ```
  Barrels : Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    : (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 : Firmly Planted
  Perks 2 : (Any perk)

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvE) Super Picky**: How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range and Stability as possible?
  ```
  Barrels : Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    : Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag

## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvP)
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! Paraphrased: There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (Slif: ?!). Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few of these. Keep in mind they don't benefit from from the S92 benefit of an additional perk in the last slot, so it can be a bit painful.
* **(PvP) Picky Tapping**: Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and Tap procs on every other burst. Going for max range after that.
  ```
  Barrels : (Any barrel)
  Mags    : High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 : Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 : Tap the Trigger

## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvE)
These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Shieldbreaker, who knew?
* **(PvE) Picky Shieldbreaker**: Don't Sleep on Disruption Break! CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks can be applied to sidearm. That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk!
