These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important. This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide on a roll yourself. E.g. Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails, those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random kinetic Auto Rifle :)

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't) that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM "Notes" section, when it could do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your own discretion.
## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
We're going for straight-up recoil and massive stability here. We can get Recoil to 100 with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance mod so the rest is about stability.  With a huge mag, 100 recoil and a lot of stability with Vorpal, this should be able to shut down some supers!

| Roll | Description |
| :--- | :---        |
| **Super Picky** | Arrowhead Brake + (HCR, Ricochet, Flared) + (Firmly Planted, Slideways) + (Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal) + Stability MW |
| **Super Picky (Minus Mag Perks)** | Arrowhead Brake + (Any) + (Firmly Planted, Slideways) + (Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal) + Stability MW |
| **Super Picky (Minus Stability MW)** | Arrowhead Brake + (HCR, Ricochet, Flared) + (Firmly Planted, Slideways) + (Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal) |
## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
We're looking for ways to keep increased DPS for longer, with Osmosis thrown in for high-end PvE w/Match Game and while I'm not super impressed with Vorpal on this weapon, why not in case it doesn't come back? I don't have a roll that just features Osmosis or Vorpal in case you want those for specific purposes, but you don't need a wishlist file to tell you to look for one perk ;) All of the available masterworks are fine; none required for a great roll here. Here we go! ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/))

| Roll | Description |

| **Super Picky + Vorpal Bonus** | (Chambered, Corkscrew, Fluted, Polygonal, Smallbore) + (Ricochet, Flared Mag, Light Mag) + Feeding Frenzy + (Swashbuckler AND Vorpal) |
| **Super Picky** | (Chambered, Corkscrew, Fluted, Polygonal, Smallbore) + (Ricochet, Flared Mag, Light Mag) + Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler |
| **Baseline** | Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler |
## Breachlight (PvP)
CoolGuy's video here is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) . "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw, it's just another two-burst sidearm, which is great but you don't need a wishlist for that :) ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/))

| Roll | Description |
| :--- | :---        |
| **Super Picky** | (Full Bore, Hammer-Forged, Smallbore, Extended Barrel) + Accurized Rounds + (*anything*) + (Vorpal, Quickdraw) + Range MW |
## Breachlight (PvE)
Some neat PvE combos here from Ehroar's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) and general PvE wisdom from CoolGuy [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) . I kind of love Breachlight so I'm going to lay down a bunch of possibilities here. The ordering of these rolls is by the final perk columns since they're the most important. Otherwise it's just another Smuggler's Word! ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/))

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s) . I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls as we're looking for. Randy's has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip, so this is a pretty low priority farm (and also why it's so specific). ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2723241847/patron-of-lost-causes/))

| Roll | Description |
| :--- | :---        |
| **Super Picky** |  (Smallbore, Corkscrew, Chambered, Polygonal, Fluted) + (Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell) + Rapid Hit + (Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal) + Stability MW |
| **Super Picky Minus Stability MW** |  (Smallbore, Corkscrew, Chambered, Polygonal, Fluted) + (Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell) + Rapid Hit + (Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal) |
| **Super Picky Minus Barrels** |  (Smallbore, Corkscrew, Chambered, Polygonal, Fluted) + (Any) + Rapid Hit + (Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal) + Stability MW |
## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s) . For PvE, it's the only scout (as of now) that can roll Vorpal and Osmosis. Not a super high priority for PvE and not a terribly hard set of perks to farm.

| **Utility** | Rapid Hit + (Osmosis, Vorpal) |
## Line in the Sand (PvE)
I only suggest this for completeness (Arc LFR in the power slot). It's not that great. Make it your lowest priority farm. Thank you Ehroar! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0) . We're looking for Rapid Hit + Firing Line.

## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
This is for use from range, and Blast Radius doesn't do anything on Wave Frame launchers - simple wishlist here :) We're looking for (Hard Launch, Quick Launch) + Auto Loading Holster + Elemental Capacitor + (Reload, Handling, Velocity MW). Why not demolitionist? You're not going to get final blows with this so much in PvP and with ALH, it will always be loaded. I'd rather have better handling or reload with Elemental Capacitor always-on. ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3850168899/martyrs-retribution/))

## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go. We're looking for (Quick Launch, Hard Launch) + (Auto Loading Holster, Threat Detector) + (Demolitionist, Lead from Gold) + (Reload, Velocity MW). Threat Detector might seem odd, but it increases reload speed and because this GL doesn't do any impact damage, it will have great reload up close.

## Gallant Charge (PvP)
Fallout has an interesting, pro-Stability take on the Gallant - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) ; "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". Its bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.

| **Super Picky (Minus Masterworks)** | (Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake) + (Particle Repeater, Projection Fuse) + (Any) + Tap the Trigger |
## Gallant Charge (PvE)
CoolGuy has a terrific PvE review of the Gallant - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) . It has a PvP perspective but it's not as strong as Fallout's below (IMHO, on this particular weapon). ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/))

## Infinite Paths 8 (PvP)
CoolGuy dropping serious knowledge here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) . "Currently they're the only frame I wouldn't take in to 5500 Comp. Use Rapid-fire frame." If you want some rolls, here's what I put together from the video: Arrowhead Brake + Steady Rounds + Moving Target + (Zen Moment, Swashbuckler) + Stability MW ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3233390913/infinite-paths-8/))
