# Welcome to the Sliflist!
This document is generated from a custom Destiny Item Manager "wishlist" and was
created on `2020-02-16 04:21:29 +00:00`. The most recent
version of this document can always be found [here](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/).

These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important.
This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide
on a roll yourself. For example Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are
`Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the
list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails,
those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random
kinetic Auto Rifle.

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't)
that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM
"Wishlist Notes" section (searchable in DIM via `wishlistnotes:`), when it could
do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your
own discretion.

## Breachlight - PvP
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal, it's just another two-burst sidearm. You may as well use a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger, which has one of the lowest TTKs in all of Destiny.
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer ðŸ’¥ (0.2% chance)**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Threat Detector
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer ðŸ’¥(Minus Accurized) (0.8% chance)**: With a Range Masterwork, you can make up for not having Accurized
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Threat Detector
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer ðŸ’¥(Minus Range MW) (0.8% chance)**: With Accurized, we're not as worried about the Range Masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Threat Detector
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer ðŸ’¥(Minus Threat) (1.2% chance)**: While Threat Detector is solid, missing it doesn't change how amazing this roll would otherwise be.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Super Killer (0.3% chance)**: Let's reboot by widening our acceptable barrels.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Threat Detector
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Super Killer (Minus Magazines) (1.2% chance)**: Same as before, minus magazines. Still a phenomenal roll without any particular magazine.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Threat Detector
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Super Killer (Minus Threat Detector) (1.7% chance)**: Same as before, minus Threat Detector since the roll is amazing without it.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Super Killer (Minus Threat Detector and Magazines) (6.9% chance)**: Same as before, minus Threat Detector since the roll is amazing without it.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore

## Breachlight - PvE
Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below. You won't see obviously good rolls here (e.g. Outlaw + MKC) because the combination is so straightforward and easy to roll. I.e. you don't need to come to a DIM wishlist to tell you that these perks pair well togther :)
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger (3.0% chance)**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake. The lack of a Range Masterwork, or any specific Masterwork doesn't make or break this roll so I'm leaving it out.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 64%): Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Multikill Clip
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloader (5.4% chance)**: Once you get on a tear, the damage perks will recharge your grenade quickly and by throwing it, you'll reload the mag. Rinse and repeat. This is especially spicy when paired with Devour-lock.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 64%): Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Master of the Void (3.0% chance)**: Pair with Devour-lock and Nezarac's sin and you'll be flush with health, grenades and ability energy.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 64%): Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Osmosis
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky (Mini)Boss Shredder (4.5% chance)**: With a Major or Boss spec, Breachlight surprisingly wrecks. Throw this on in Sundial and watch what happens to Champions and Bosses.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    ( 64%): Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
## Gallant Charge - PvP
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.
* **(PvP) Super Picky Stability (1.3% chance)**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 33%): Particle Repeater
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Tap the Trigger
  MWorks  ( 20%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Stability (Minus Magazines) (3.9% chance)**: Same as above, minus the magazines.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)

  MWorks  ( 20%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Stability (Minus Masterworks) (6.5% chance)**: Same as above, minus the masterworks.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake

  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Tap the Trigger
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Range / Stability Mix (4.7% chance)**: The next few rolls feature both Stability and Range alternatives in three of the slots.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 60%): Particle Repeater, Projection Fuse
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Tap the Trigger

## Gallant Charge - PvE
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon).
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS (4.2% chance)**: How can we maximize damage uptime and bolt hits while minimizing falloff?
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    ( 60%): Projection Fuse, Ionized Battery
  Perks 1 ( 40%): Demolitionist, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Swashbuckler, Multikill Clip

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvP
CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&feature=youtu.be&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK.
* **(PvP) Picky (0.0% chance)**: This roll focuses on addressing recoil and stability. Because it needs so much help, there isn't much room left for neat damage perks :)
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Chambered Compensator
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Moving Target
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Zen Moment
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Long-Distance Melee'r (0.0% chance)**: Useful for those subclasses with ranged melees. This is a fringe roll, one that I wouldn't throw away but not one that I'm racing to collect.
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Chambered Compensator
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Moving Target
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Swashbuckler
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
## Infinite Paths 8 - PvE
Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available?
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon (2.8% chance)**: This is the only weapon in the game that has this perk combo available! Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist. It does work. Probably not your best Energy weapon but a fun one for shredding red bars. I would collect it and store it.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Punchy ðŸ‘Š (2.8% chance)**: Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. ðŸ‘ŠPUNCH AWAY!ðŸ‘Š
  ```

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvP
This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons and the only other Energy HCs apart from Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u) with `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling! For analysis and gameplay, check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and medium range one is about half a meter". Yes for falloff that's true, but since Range affects stickyness, it's still got value here. For some of us (myself included), [CoolGuy's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5CjuOonRc) on the JKQ3 might be more up your alley, PvP-wise: "For Crucible it isnâ€™t necessarily bad, but itâ€™s kind of an acquired taste." It's never clicked with me but some people absolutely love it. IMHO similar to Sunshot - it's great on paper but the model is so chunky that it obscures where you're aiming when it kicks up. Its stiff competition and model/kick funkyness are why these rolls are so narrow. It needs a lot to compete with Luna's, Not Forgotten and Waking Vigil (which can be farmed from Menagerie with a predetermined Masterwork). The second set of these rolls is meant to be slightly more forgiving if you really want Demo and/or Snapshot.
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (0.1% chance)**: Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get  this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much Stability and Handling as we can get.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 25%): Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Snapshot
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (Sans Demo) (0.7% chance)**: The first thing we're going to do is remove Demo from the list of required perks. The roll is top-tier without it.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 25%): Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Snapshot
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (Sans Snapshot) (4.2% chance)**: Same as above, minus Snapshot. Snapshot is terrific but it doesn't make or break the roll.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 25%): Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 (100%): (Any perk)
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky, But Not That Picky (0.5% chance)**: Similar to the above rolls but we're going to widen our acceptable set of barrels and magazines from the get-go.
  ```
  Barrels ( 80%): Truesight HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 46%): Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Snapshot
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky, But Not That Picky (Sans Demo) (3.1% chance)**: The first thing we're going to do is remove Demo from the list of required perks. The roll is solid without it.
  ```
  Barrels ( 80%): Truesight HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 46%): Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell

  ```
## Jack Queen King 3 - PvE
[Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ): "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and  Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns. CoolGuy has a [great set of rolls](https://youtu.be/XI5CjuOonRc?t=463) I'm incorporating here as well. "Very stout PvE hand cannon; top-tier."
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky) (2.0% chance)**: Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't forget Dragonfly Spec! Per CoolGuy, this is a rarely available combo; pick it up.
  ```
  Barrels ( 93%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 33%): Demolitionist, Subsistence
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Sans Masterworks) (4.1% chance)**: Same as the above with relaxed masterworks. Neither good nor bad enough to tank or make the roll.
  ```
  Barrels ( 93%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 33%): Demolitionist, Subsistence
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) The Never-Ending Reloader (Super Picky) (2.0% chance)**: You'll almost never have to reload here, because getting kills with the sustained DPS perks will give you your grenade back and using your grenade will reload the magazine.
  ```
  Barrels ( 93%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS

## Line in the Sand - PvE
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
* **(PvE) Super Picky (0.4% chance)**: The full suite of perks to maximize DPS with LitS.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 33%): Accelerated Coils
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Firing Line
  MWorks  ( 20%): Charge MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline (5.6% chance)**: Really, any roll with these two perks is Good Enough(tm).
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)

## Martyr's Retribution - PvP
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for Velocity, Reload and Handling wherever I can get it. The base Velocity is `76` and since the second column perks are fixed, that's a flat `+9` so we're at `84`. That seems more than good enough, so lets focus on Reload and Handling. There's only one roll here because it's not that hard to farm. I don't require Demolitionist here because like Fighting Lion, I see Martyr's more as a starter than a finisher. By all means, roll with it - but I don't think it's absence is cause for valuing a roll any less.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (6.1% chance)**: Threat Detector has such a long proc range that I'm going to put it on par with Auto-Loading Holster here. We can choose (or not choose) to use the reload and handling boosts on Elemental Capacitor, paired with the masterworks. Don't forget a `Quick Access Sling` mod!
  ```
  Barrels ( 95%): Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    ( 100%): High-Velocity Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 40%): Threat Detector, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  ( 40%): Reload MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Capacitor) (15.2% chance)**: Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor which is the hardest to get out of the other perks.
  ```
  Barrels ( 95%): Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    ( 100%): High-Velocity Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 40%): Threat Detector, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 (100%): (Any perk)
  MWorks  ( 40%): Reload MW, Handling MW
  ```
## Martyr's Retribution - PvE
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) The Instant Reloader (4.6% chance)**: We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly?
  ```
  Barrels ( 95%): Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    ( 100%): High-Velocity Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 60%): Auto-Loading Holster, Threat Detector, Field Prep
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Demolitionist
  MWorks  ( 20%): Reload MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker (1.5% chance)**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...
  ```
  Barrels ( 95%): Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    ( 100%): High-Velocity Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 20%): Genesis
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Demolitionist
  MWorks  ( 20%): Reload MW
  ```
## Patron of Lost Causes - PvP
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls. Randy's is in the same slot and has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip already, so I'm not losing too much sleep about getting a perfect roll here.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (1.8% chance)**: This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel
  Mags    ( 64%): Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 ( 80%): Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Barrels) (2.1% chance)**: Same as above, minus the barrels
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)

  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Patron of Lost Causes - PvE
This is the only Scout Rifle that can roll Vorpal or Osmosis. This isn't a high priority roll for you to go after and it's also pretty much the core components of the PvP rolls we have down already. With the S92 double-perk bonus, you should be able to get one of these pretty promptly :)
* **(PvE) Utility (10.0% chance)**: Future-proofing
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Rapid Hit

  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Perfect Paradox - PvE
For PvE, [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) likes Demolitionist with Swashbuckler or Rampage for a large damage boost.
Trench barrel has been nerfed to the point where there are better options but it could be worth picking one up in case the perk gets revived.
There are also better One-Two Punch shotguns, but it wouldn't be a bad secondary perk if you're at s92.
For PvP, he likes Slideshot with Opening Shot or Rampage and  [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA2gxu6OIUI) agrees with him.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (otherwise there are better options) (0.5% chance)**: Range and Rampage or Opening Shot
  ```
  Barrels ( 60%): Full Choke, Rifled Barrel
  Mags    ( 33%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Slideshot
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Opening Shot
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Demolitionist (3.0% chance)**: Demolitionist grenade builds
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 60%): Appended Mag, Tactical Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Swashbuckler
  MWorks  ( 50%): Range MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline Demolitionist (10.0% chance)**: Demolitionist grenade builds
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Swashbuckler
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Steelfeather Repeater - PvP
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky (0.3% chance)**: We're looking to max stability after maxing recoil, as much as we can. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are terrific of course, but without those two, we don't have enough control to matter.
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 46%): Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Firmly Planted
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Relaxed Magazines) (0.6% chance)**: Same as above with a broader set of acceptable magazines. Most of the Stability comes from `Firmly Planted` so any Range or Stability boost from these mags is just gravy.
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 89%): High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Firmly Planted
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Capacitor) (1.7% chance)**: Same as above, minus the requirement for `Elemental Capacitor`. While it does give us a big Stability boost with the matching subclass equipped, the roll still works super well without it.
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 89%): High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Firmly Planted
  Perks 2 (100%): (Any perk)
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
## Steelfeather Repeater - PvE
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvE) Super Picky (7.2% chance)**: How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range and Stability as possible?
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    ( 78%): Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 33%): Feeding Frenzy, Subsistence
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Swashbuckler, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Super Punchy Picky ðŸ‘Š (2.0% chance)**: Classic punchy combo!
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    ( 78%): Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Grave Robber
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Swashbuckler
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker / Future-Proofing (2.5% chance)**: With artifacts all over the map, it's possible we get another Barrier mod that applies to Auto Rifles. This could be a fun one to bank.
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    ( 25%): Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 33%): Feeding Frenzy, Subsistence
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Osmosis
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvP
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! Paraphrased: There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (Slif: ?!). Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few of these. Keep in mind they don't benefit from from the Season Pass L92  additional perk in the last slot, so it can be a bit painful. Recently, True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08) and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls. I've included all but the worst two sights that majorly ding Stability and Handling.
* **(PvP) Super Pickiest of Tappers (0.1% chance)**: Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and TtT procs on every other burst. Going for max range after that. This is going to be an incredibly hard roll to get, so buy a lottery ticket if it lands for you.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Control SAS
  Mags    ( 64%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvE
These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Shieldbreaker, who knew?
* **(PvE) Picky Shieldbreaker (1.4% chance)**: Don't Sleep on Disruption Break! CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks can be applied to sidearms. That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk!
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)

## Trophy Hunter - PvP
More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon.
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Ridiculously Picky) (0.4% chance)**: Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it doesn't feel so sluggish.  I don't know that this makes it some kind of S-Tier sniper but why not give it a shot? Sniping is so personal.
  ```
  Barrels ( 41%): Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel
  Mags    ( 28%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 25%): Pulse Monitor
  Perks 2 ( 50%): Snapshot
  MWorks  ( 25%): Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Super Picky) (2.9% chance)**: Relaxing our available selection of barrels to all but the few that hinder the already low Handling. Also dropping a Magazine requirement because none of them are so harmful as to tank the roll or helpful as to propel it.
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

  Perks 2 ( 50%): Snapshot

  Perks 2 ( 50%): Snapshot

## Trophy Hunter - PvE
CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated). Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance. You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo of the barrel perk and Masterwork.
* **(PvE) "Triple Tap Your Way to Seven" (1.5% chance)**: That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here to be able to do that.
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    ( 52%): Appended Mag, Extended Mag
  Perks 1 ( 25%): Triple Tap
  Perks 2 ( 50%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Gambit Shieldbreaker (2.7% chance)**: Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

  ```
* **(PvE) Infinite Ammo (4.5% chance)**: Heavyweight modifier? Never run out of ammo. Famine modifier? That rare Heavy brick is like finding a Special brick at the same time.

## Black Scorpion-4sr - PvP
[CoolGuy's BS4 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) in August of 2019 is great source of info. It's using the original D2Y1 perk pool so what I'm suggesting here is likely not to be too much of a surprise. Unfortunately there are *seven* perks in the final two columns making them a beast to lock down; these rolls will be tough to get. Recoil is `60`, demanding we use a Counterbalance mod. Check out CoolGuy's video for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400). Because of this, you're not going to see me recommend Rampage + Rampage Spec. Range-wise, the base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find often on a PvP map, so we're kind of OK with it. Because it's full auto, we're going to be focused on Stability. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your *base* Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability for the Black Scorpion is pretty darn high @ `54`. No Outlaw because the reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of. For more sample footage, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action.
* **(PvP) Picky Stability (0.4% chance)**: As much Stability however we can get it. You have almost no chance at getting this to drop :)

## Black Scorpion-4sr - PvE
What, no PvE rolls?! Nope. Being rapid-fire/low impact and having none of the spicy new damage perks (Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler, Vorpal, etc.) it's really not worth taking in to PvE. It's also perked weirdly, with Outlaw and Rampage being in the same slot, among others. There are so many amazing Energy weapons for PvE, it's hard to imagine this ever being top of your list. Go enjoy farming something else :)
## Bygones - PvP
You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because, well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Why Bygones? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault! Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls: (1) Strongly consider using a single +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get the Recoil to 94 which is basically straight up and down. Arrowhead Brake will let us do this without a mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range benefits of those other barrels (2) Handling is solid, among the highest of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this (3) With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range, precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off before Slideshot dissipates. If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE). He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW. I am requiring Kill Clip because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.
* **(PvP) Absurdly Picky (0.4% chance)**: Going for maximum Stability here; at least a little bit in every column. If you get this roll, buy both of us a lottery ticket. "But Slif, Range improves accuracy and damage falloff" Check out the ZkMushroom video above and tell me if you think the lack of Range-boosting perks handicaps Bygones here.

The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it, so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

## Bygones - PvE
The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal. Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault. We're going for sustained DPS and maximum range falloff. Stability is already high enough and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage Spec mod on it!
* **(PvE) Super Picky (1.1% chance)**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 20%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Kill Clip, Rampage
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Super Picky (Minus MW) (4.5% chance)**: Same as above, minus the masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 20%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Kill Clip, Rampage
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline / Future-Proofing (8.0% chance)**: This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a standard DPS roll. Without perks in both of these columns, there's not a strong reason to run this in PvE. If this is all you end up getting, fine to hang on to it and hope for an archetype buff at some point.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
