These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important. This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide on a roll yourself. E.g. Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails, those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random kinetic Auto Rifle :)

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't) that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM "Notes" section, when it could do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your own discretion.
## Breachlight (PvP)
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw, it's just another two-burst sidearm, which is great but you don't need a wishlist for that :)
* **(PvP) Slif's Super Picky (0.3% chance)**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Threat Detector
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (1.4% chance)**: Any roll in this set would give you an A+ PvP roll. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw in the final column, you're better off using a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 50%): Threat Detector, Demolitionist, Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Vorpal, Quickdraw
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus MW and Accurized) (21.7% chance)**: Same as before, minus the Range MW and Accurized Rounds since you have only a 25% to get each of them. This is still an amazing roll.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 50%): Threat Detector, Demolitionist, Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Vorpal, Quickdraw
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Baseline (43.3% chance)**: You've got basically a 50% chance of getting this roll :) Yes it would be awesome to have +20 range from Accurized and a Range MW but it's still a great weapon.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Vorpal, Quickdraw
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Breachlight (PvE)
Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below.
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger (0.3% chance)**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Multikill Clip
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Basic Gunslinger (5.6% chance)**: Same as above, minus the magazine and masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Multikill Clip
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloading Devour-lock (0.6% chance)**: With Devour on, you'll have your grenade constantly and since throwing your grenade reloads the weapon, you can keep `Rampage x 3` up for a long time.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloading Devour-lock (Minus Magazines) (2.5% chance)**: Same as above, minus Accurized Rounds since it's so much harder to get than Range MW.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Multikill Clip

  ```

  ```

  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Rarely-Reloading Bezerker (0.6% chance)**: With Drop Mag and a Reload MW, you'll be able to keep Rampage up. You could also do this with
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 25%): Drop Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Basic Rarely-Reloading Bezerker (2.5% chance)**: Same as above, minus the Masterwork
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 25%): Drop Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Master of the Void (0.3% chance)**: Pair with Devour-lock and Nezarac's sin and you'll be flush with health, grenades and ability energy.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Osmosis
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Basic Master of the Void (5.6% chance)**: Same as above with just the core perks.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Osmosis
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
## Gallant Charge (PvP)
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.
* **(PvP) Super Picky Stability (1.3% chance)**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 33%): Particle Repeater
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Tap the Trigger

  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Range / Stability Mix (4.7% chance)**: The next few rolls feature both Stability and Range alternatives in three of the slots.
  ```
  Barrels ( 58%): Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 60%): Particle Repeater, Projection Fuse
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)

  ```
## Gallant Charge (PvE)
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon).
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS (4.2% chance)**: How can we maximize damage uptime and bolt hits while minimizing falloff?
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    ( 60%): Projection Fuse, Ionized Battery
  Perks 1 ( 40%): Demolitionist, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Swashbuckler, Multikill Clip

## Infinite Paths 8 (PvP)
CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&feature=youtu.be&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK.
* **(PvP) Picky (0.0% chance)**: This roll focuses on addressing recoil and stability. Because it needs so much help, there isn't much room left for neat damage perks :)
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Chambered Compensator
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Moving Target
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Zen Moment
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Long-Distance Melee'r (0.0% chance)**: Useful for those subclasses with ranged melees. This is a fringe roll, one that I wouldn't throw away but not one that I'm racing to collect.
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Chambered Compensator
  Mags    ( 25%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Moving Target
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Swashbuckler
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
## Infinite Paths 8 (PvE)
Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available?
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon (2.8% chance)**: This is the only weapon in the game that has this perk combo available! Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist. It does work. Probably not your best Energy weapon but a fun one for shredding red bars. I would collect it and store it.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Punchy 👊 (2.8% chance)**: Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. 👊PUNCH AWAY!👊
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)

## Jack Queen King 3 (PvP)
This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons apart from Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u). `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling are nuts! For analysis and gameplay, check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and medium range one is about half a meter" so I'm not going to value a combination of Range perks highly here. The Handling is phenomenal, so I'm not going to value Snapshot super highly either.
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (0.1% chance)**: Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get  this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much Stability as we can get.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 25%): Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Rampage

  Mags    ( 46%): Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell

  Perks 2 ( 16%): Rampage

  ```

  ```
* **(PvP) Picky Range/Stability Mix (Minus Masterworks) (2.3% chance)**: Same as the above, minus the masterwork requirements.
  ```
  Barrels ( 93%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 89%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Rampage
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Firestarter (0.8% chance)**: Let's see how much damage we can do in PvP with a Dragonfly Spec mod on this weird roll.
  ```
  Barrels ( 80%): Truesight HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 46%): Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 50%): Demolitionist, Threat Detector, Pulse Monitor
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Firestarter (Relaxed) (6.9% chance)**: Same as the above, loosened barrels, magazines and Masterworks.
  ```
  Barrels ( 93%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 89%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 50%): Demolitionist, Threat Detector, Pulse Monitor
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Perkless Wonder (2.1% chance)**: Listen, the base stats are so good that if we toss out the hardest to get perk columns, we still have something pretty amazing.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 25%): Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 (100%): (Any perk)
  Perks 2 (100%): (Any perk)
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Perkless Wonder (Slightly Relaxed) (9.3% chance)**: Let's let in a few more barrels and magazines.
  ```

  Perks 2 (100%): (Any perk)
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Perkless Wonder (Very Relaxed) (41.7% chance)**: Even without much greatness in the core perk columns, with the other columns on some solid perks, this thing will do work.
  ```
  Barrels ( 93%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    ( 89%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag

## Jack Queen King 3 (PvE)
[Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ): "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and  Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns.
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky) (0.9% chance)**: Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't forget Dragonfly Spec!
  ```
  Barrels ( 80%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Crossfire HCS
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 33%): Demolitionist, Subsistence
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Relaxed) (4.4% chance)**: Same as the above with relaxed barrels and masterworks. Neither good nor bad enough to tank or make the roll.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 33%): Demolitionist, Subsistence
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Dragonfly
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) The Never-Ending Reloader (Super Picky) (0.9% chance)**: You'll almost never have to reload here, because getting kills with the sustained DPS perks will give you your grenade back and using your grenace will reload the magazine.
  ```
  Barrels ( 80%): Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Crossfire HCS
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag

## Line in the Sand (PvE)
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
* **(PvE) Super Picky (0.4% chance)**: The full suite of perks to maximize DPS with LitS.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    ( 33%): Accelerated Coils
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Firing Line
  MWorks  ( 20%): Charge MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline (5.6% chance)**: Really, any roll with these two perks is Good Enough(tm).

## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for velocity, reload and handling wherever I can get it. The base Velocity is `76` and since the second column perks are fixed, that's a flat `+9` so we're at `84`. That seems more than good enough, so lets focus on reload + handling. There's only one roll here because it's not that hard to farm.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (4.6% chance)**: Threat Detector has such a long proc range that I'm going to put it on par with Auto-Loading Holster here. We can choose (or not choose) to use the reload and handling boosts on Elemental Capacitor, paired with the masterworks. Don't forget a `Quick Access Sling` mod!
  ```
  Barrels ( 71%): Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 40%): Threat Detector, Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  ( 40%): Reload MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Picky (11.4% chance)**: Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor which is the hardest to get out of the other perks.
  ```

  ```
## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) The Instant Reloader (3.4% chance)**: We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly?
  ```
  Barrels ( 71%): Countermass, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control

* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker (2.3% chance)**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls. Randy's is in the same slot and has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip already, so I'm not losing too much sleep about getting a perfect roll here.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (1.8% chance)**: This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better.
  ```
  Barrels ( 83%): Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel
  Mags    ( 64%): Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell

  Perks 2 ( 80%): Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor, Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky (Minus Barrels) (2.1% chance)**: Same as above, minus the barrels
  ```

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
This is the only Scout Rifle that can roll Vorpal or Osmosis. This isn't a high priority roll for you to go after and it's also pretty much the core components of the PvP rolls we have down already. With the S92 double-perk bonus, you should be able to get one of these pretty promptly :)
* **(PvE) Utility (10.0% chance)**: Future-proofing

  ```
## Perfect Paradox (PvE)
For PvE, [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) likes Demolitionist with Swashbuckler or Rampage for a large damage boost.
Trench barrel has been nerfed to the point where there are better options but it could be worth picking one up in case the perk gets revived.
There are also better One-Two Punch shotguns, but it wouldn't be a bad secondary perk if you're at s92.
For PvP, he likes Slideshot with Opening Shot or Rampage and  [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA2gxu6OIUI) agrees with him.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (otherwise there are better options) (0.5% chance)**: Range and Rampage or Opening Shot
  ```
  Barrels ( 60%): Full Choke, Rifled Barrel
  Mags    ( 33%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Slideshot
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Opening Shot
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Demolitionist (3.0% chance)**: Demolitionist grenade builds
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)

  Perks 1 ( 16%): Demolitionist
  Perks 2 ( 60%): Rampage, Swashbuckler
  MWorks  ( 50%): Range MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline Demolitionist (10.0% chance)**: Demolitionist grenade builds
  ```

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky (0.4% chance)**: We're looking to max stability after maxing recoil, as much as we can. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are terrific of course, but without those two, we don't have enough control to matter.
  ```
  Barrels ( 22%): Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 64%): Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Firmly Planted
  Perks 2 ( 33%): Elemental Capacitor
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvE) Super Picky (7.2% chance)**: How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range and Stability as possible?
  ```

## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvP)
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! Paraphrased: There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (Slif: ?!). Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger being available is a rare combo. Worth your time to farm a few of these. Keep in mind they don't benefit from from the Season Pass L92  additional perk in the last slot, so it can be a bit painful. Recently, True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08) and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls. I've included all but the worst two sights that majorly ding Stability and Handling.
* **(PvP) Super Pickiest of Tappers (0.1% chance)**: Rapid Hit makes it incredibly stable and TtT procs on every other burst. Going for max range after that. This is going to be an incredibly hard roll to get, so buy a lottery ticket if it lands for you.
  ```
  Barrels ( 33%): Control SAS

## Traveler's Judgement 5 (PvE)
These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Shieldbreaker, who knew?
* **(PvE) Picky Shieldbreaker (1.4% chance)**: Don't Sleep on Disruption Break! CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks can be applied to sidearms. That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk!
  ```

## Trophy Hunter (PvP)
More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon.
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Ridiculously Picky) (0.4% chance)**: Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it doesn't feel so sluggish.  I don't know that this makes it some kind of S-Tier sniper but why not give it a shot? Sniping is so personal.
  ```
  Barrels ( 41%): Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel
  Mags    ( 28%): Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 25%): Pulse Monitor
  Perks 2 ( 50%): Snapshot
  MWorks  ( 25%): Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Super Picky) (2.9% chance)**: Relaxing our available selection of barrels to all but the few that hinder the already low Handling. Also dropping a Magazine requirement because none of them are so harmful as to tank the roll or helpful as to propel it.

## Trophy Hunter (PvE)
CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated). Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance. You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo of the barrel perk and Masterwork.
* **(PvE) "Triple Tap Your Way to Seven" (1.5% chance)**: That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here to be able to do that.
  ```
  Barrels ( 91%): Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

  Perks 2 ( 50%): Vorpal
  MWorks  ( 25%): Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Gambit Shieldbreaker (2.7% chance)**: Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.

## Black Scorpion-4sr (PvP)
[CoolGuy's BS4 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) in August of 2019 is great source of info. It's using the original D2Y1 perk pool so what I'm suggesting here is likely not to be too much of a surprise. Since this is a wishlist for controller, the Recoil is `60`, demanding we use a Counterbalance mod to make even passable. Check out CoolGuy's video for a before/after (@6:40). On PC, sure, skip that but because of this, you're not going to see me recommend Rampage + Rampage Spec. Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action. Not gonna lie here... these rolls are *tough* to get, because you only get one crack at the perks in the final two columns.
* **(PvP) 100 Recoil + Maxing Stability (0.1% chance)**: This is a Scout Rifle and there aren't many lanes on Crucible maps where you're going to see appreciable Range falloff *and* where you could also imagine holding a Rapid-Fire Full-Auto Scout Rifle steady enough to get hits. That means we're going for Recoil and Stability. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your *base* Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability for the Black Scorpion is pretty darn high @ `54`. No Outlaw because the reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of. Throw a Counterbalance mod on here to hit `100` Recoil.
  ```
  Barrels ( 25%): Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    ( 71%): Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Zen Moment
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Rangefinder
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Maxing Stability; Recoil 75 (0.3% chance)**: Similar to the above, but we're choosing some of the better Stability granting barrels. Still requires you to install a Counterbalance mod.
  ```
  Barrels ( 64%): Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    ( 71%): Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 ( 16%): Zen Moment
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Rangefinder
  MWorks  ( 25%): Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Mixing Range/Stability; Recoil 75 (2.4% chance)**: Similar to the above, but we're relaxing constraints to include a mix of Range and Stability. Here we're adding Moving Target which gives you +5 Aim Assist and +20 Mobility. I'm not includin Arrowhead Brake here because it's not helping us with Range or Stability.
  ```
  Barrels ( 100%): Chambered Compensator, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore

  Perks 1 ( 33%): Zen Moment, Moving Target
  Perks 2 ( 16%): Rangefinder
  MWorks  ( 50%): Stability MW, Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Baseline (Range/Stability Mix) (42.9% chance)**: Similar to the above, but we're dropping the two hardest to get columns from the mix. The other columns are pretty do-able.
  ```
  Barrels ( 100%): Chambered Compensator, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore

## Black Scorpion-4sr (PvE)
What, no PvE rolls?! Nope. Being rapid-fire/low impact and having none of the spicy new damage perks (Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler, Vorpal, etc.) it's really not worth taking in to PvE. It's also perked weirdly, with Outlaw and Rampage being in the same slot, among others. There are so many amazing Energy weapons for PvE, it's hard to imagine this ever being top of your list. Go enjoy farming something else :)
## Bygones (PvP)
You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because, well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Why Bygones? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault! Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls: (1) Strongly consider using a single +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get the Recoil to 94 which is basically straight up and down. Arrowhead Brake will let us do this without a mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range benefits of those other barrels (2) Handling is solid, among the highest of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this (3) With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range, precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off before Slideshot dissipates. If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE). He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW. I am requiring Kill Clip because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.
* **(PvP) Absurdly Picky (0.4% chance)**: Going for maximum Stability here; at least a little bit in every column. If you get this roll, buy both of us a lottery ticket. "But Slif, Range improves accuracy and damage falloff" Check out the ZkMushroom video above and tell me if you think the lack of Range-boosting perks handicaps Bygones here.

* **(PvP) CammyCakes 2-tapper (3.6% chance)**: This is really just for grins. I haven't played with it myself but check out [Cammy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBfOa69GjGU) for more. The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it, so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

  ```
* **(PvP) "I got 99 problems and recoil ain't 1" (Picky) (0.4% chance)**: With Arrowhead Brake's +30 to recoil (=99), you can forego a Counterbalance mod and throw on a Rampage Spec instead.
  ```

* **(PvP) "I got 99 problems and recoil ain't 1" (Relaxed) (0.9% chance)**: Same as the above but we're relaxing magazines and masterworks since none are harmful to the roll, just not optimally helpful. They don't make or break (brake? hah) this roll.

## Bygones (PvE)
The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal. Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault. We're going for sustained DPS and maximum range falloff. Stability is already high enough and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage Spec mod on it!
* **(PvE) Super Picky (1.1% chance)**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 20%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Kill Clip, Rampage
  MWorks  ( 25%): Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Super Picky (Minus MW) (4.5% chance)**: Same as above, minus the masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels ( 72%): Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    ( 78%): High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 ( 20%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Kill Clip, Rampage
  MWorks  (100%): (Any masterwork)
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline / Future-Proofing (8.0% chance)**: This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a standard DPS roll. Without perks in both of these columns, there's not a strong reason to run this in PvE. If this is all you end up getting, fine to hang on to it and hope for an archetype buff at some point.
  ```
  Barrels (100%): (Any barrel)
  Mags    (100%): (Any magazine)
  Perks 1 ( 20%): Outlaw
  Perks 2 ( 40%): Kill Clip, Rampage
