## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
//notes:We're going for straight-up recoil and insane stability here. We can get Recoil to 100 with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance mod. We're looking for: Arrowhead Brake + (HCR, Ricochet) + Firmly Planted + Elemental Capacitor + Stability MW

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
//notes:We're looking for ways to keep increased DPS for longer, with Osmosis thrown in for high-end PvE w/Match Game and since we can roll two perks, why not Vorpal? For a PvE roll, barrel, first-column and masterwork perks are gravy. We're looking for: Feeding Frenzy + (Swashbuckler + Vorpal, Osmosis + Vorpal)

## Steelfeather Repeater (Garbo)
//notes:Any roll that isn't one of our solid PvE or PvP rolls.

## Breachlight (PvE)
//notes:Some neat PvE combos here from Ehroar's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) and general PvE wisdom from CoolGuy [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) . I kind of love Breachlight so I'm going to lay down a bunch of possibilities here, contained in the wishlist.txt file.

## Breachlight (PvE)
//notes:Outlaw + Multikill Clip + (Drop Mag, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag) + Stability MW

## Breachlight (PvP)
//notes:CoolGuy's video here is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) . "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." Here's what I decided after watching the video: (Full Bore, Hammer-Forged, Smallbore, Extended Barrel) + Accurized Rounds + (*anything*) + (Vorpal, Quickdraw) + Range MW

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
//notes:CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s) . For PvE, it's the only scout (as of now) that can roll Vorpal and Osmosis. Not a super high priority for PvE and not a terribly hard set of perks to farm.

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
//notes:CoolGuy goes ham on PoLC - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI&t=824s) . I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls as we're looking for (Smallbore, Corkscrew, Chambered, Polygonal, Fluted) + (Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell) + Rapid Hit + (Explosive Rounds, Elemental Capacitor) + Stability MW

## Line in the Sand (PvE)
//notes:I only suggest this for completeness (legendary arc LFR in the power slot). It's not that great. Make it your lowest priority farm. Thank you Ehroar! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0) . We're looking for Rapid Hit + Firing Line.

## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
//notes:This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go. We're looking for (Countermass, Smart Drift Control, Quick Launch, Hard Launch) + (Auto Loading Holster, Threat Detector) + demolitionist + (Any Masterwork). Threat Detector might seem odd, but it increases reload speed and because this GL doesn't do any impact damage, it will have great reload up close.

## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
//notes:This is for use from range, and Blast Radius doesn't do anything on Wave Frame launchers - simple wishlist here :) We're looking for (Smart Drift Control, Quick Launch) + Auto Loading Holster + Elemental Capacitor + (Reload, Handling MW). Why not demolitionist? You're not going to get final blows with this so much in PvP and with ALH, it will always be loaded. I'd rather have better handling or reload with Elemental Capacitor always-on.

## Gallant Charge (PvE)
//notes:Fusions don't totally shine in PvE but with Demolitionist this could be interesting. Add in Swashbuckler for an instant x5 on melee kills (over Rampage) and you have an interesting one to consider. Barrels, magazines and masterworks don't matter too much here.
 ([view item on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/))
## Gallant Charge (PvP)
//notes:Gallant Charge is to Stability as Erentil is to Range. If you want great range, farm an Erentil from Menagerie. I want something different so these rolls are all about maximizing stability wherever possible. We're looking for (Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator) + Particle Repeater + Demolitionist + Tap the Trigger + Stability MW.

## Infinite Paths 8 (PvE)
//notes:CoolGuy dropping serious knowledge here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) . "Great for mid and low-tier adds." We're going for either Demo+Dragon (don't forget a dragonfly spec!) or Grave Robber + Swashbuckler.

## Infinite Paths 8 (PvP)
//notes:CoolGuy dropping serious knowledge here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) . "Currently they're the only frame I wouldn't take in to 5500 Comp. Use Rapid-fire frame." If you want some rolls, here's what I put together from the video: Arrowhead Brake + Steady Rounds + Moving Target + (Zen Moment, Swashbuckler) + Stability MW

//notes:CoolGuy brings the heat again! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) . We're looking for (Rapid Hit, Feeding Frenzy) + (Disruption Break, Dragonfly). Watch the video to see why Disruption Break is recommended :)
