# Welcome to the Sliflist!
This document is generated from a custom Destiny Item Manager "wishlist" and was
created on `2020-02-22 06:08:06 +00:00`. The most recent
version of this document can always be found [here](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/).

These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important.
This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide
on a roll yourself. For example Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are
`Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the
list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails,
those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random
kinetic Auto Rifle.

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't)
that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM
"Wishlist Notes" section (searchable in DIM via `wishlistnotes:`), when it could
do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your
own discretion.

**Some rolls are missing PvE or PvP sections. What gives?** If that's the case,
I'm of the opinion it's not worth chasing ツ

## Breachlight - PvP
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal, it's just another two-burst sidearm. You may as well use a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger, which has one of the lowest TTKs in all of Destiny.
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥 (0.2% chance)**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 25%]: Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Threat Detector
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Vorpal
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥(Minus Accurized) (0.8% chance)**: With a Range Masterwork, you can make up for not having Accurized

  MWorks  [100%]: *

## Breachlight - PvE
Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below. You won't see obviously good rolls here (e.g. Outlaw + MKC) because the combination is so straightforward and easy to roll. I.e. you don't need to come to a DIM wishlist to tell you that these perks pair well togther :)
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger (3.0% chance)**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake. The lack of a Range Masterwork, or any specific Masterwork doesn't make or break this roll so I'm leaving it out.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Outlaw
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Multikill Clip
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloader (5.4% chance)**: Once you get on a tear, the damage perks will recharge your grenade quickly and by throwing it, you'll reload the mag. Rinse and repeat. This is especially spicy when paired with Devour-lock.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 60%]: Rampage, Multikill Clip
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky Master of the Void (3.0% chance)**: Pair with Devour-lock and Nezarac's sin and you'll be flush with health, grenades and ability energy.
  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 64%]: Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell

  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Osmosis
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Picky (Mini)Boss Shredder (4.5% chance)**: With a Major or Boss spec, Breachlight surprisingly wrecks. Throw this on in Sundial and watch what happens to Champions and Bosses.
  ```

## Gallant Charge - PvP
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.
* **(PvP) Super Picky Stability (1.3% chance)**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!
  ```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake

## Gallant Charge - PvE
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon).
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS (4.2% chance)**: How can we maximize damage uptime and bolt hits while minimizing falloff?
  ```

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvP
CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&feature=youtu.be&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK.
* **(PvP) Picky (0.0% chance)**: This roll focuses on addressing recoil and stability. Because it needs so much help, there isn't much room left for neat damage perks :)
  ```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Chambered Compensator
  Mags    [ 25%]: Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Moving Target
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Zen Moment
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Long-Distance Melee'r (0.0% chance)**: Useful for those subclasses with ranged melees. This is a fringe roll, one that I wouldn't throw away but not one that I'm racing to collect.
  ```

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvE
Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available?
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon (2.8% chance)**: This is the only weapon in the game that has this perk combo available! Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist. It does work. Probably not your best Energy weapon but a fun one for shredding red bars. I would collect it and store it.

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvP
This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons and the only other Energy HCs apart from Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u) with `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling! For analysis and gameplay, check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and medium range one is about half a meter". Yes for falloff that's true, but since Range affects stickyness, it's still got value here. For some of us (myself included), [CoolGuy's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5CjuOonRc) on the JKQ3 might be more up your alley, PvP-wise: "For Crucible it isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s kind of an acquired taste." It's never clicked with me but some people absolutely love it. IMHO similar to Sunshot - it's great on paper but the model is so chunky that it obscures where you're aiming when it kicks up. Its stiff competition and model/kick funkyness are why these rolls are so narrow. It needs a lot to compete with Luna's, Not Forgotten and Waking Vigil (which can be farmed from Menagerie with a predetermined Masterwork). The second set of these rolls is meant to be slightly more forgiving if you really want Demo and/or Snapshot.
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (0.1% chance)**: Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get  this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much Stability and Handling as we can get.
  ```

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvE
[Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ): "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and  Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns. CoolGuy has a [great set of rolls](https://youtu.be/XI5CjuOonRc?t=463) I'm incorporating here as well. "Very stout PvE hand cannon; top-tier."
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky) (2.0% chance)**: Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't forget Dragonfly Spec! Per CoolGuy, this is a rarely available combo; pick it up.

## Line in the Sand - PvE
Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?

## Martyr's Retribution - PvP
I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for Reload and Velocity in that order. The base Velocity @ `86` and Reload @ `77` (thanks to `High-Velocity Rounds` being one of two fixed barrels) seems more than good enough, so lets focus on Reload and Handling. I don't require Demolitionist because like Fighting Lion, I see Martyr's more as a starter than a finisher. By all means, roll with it, but I'm more excited about the perks below because I think we'll get more consistent utility from them. With breach-load launchers, we're going to run `Quick Access Sling`, which buffs swapping speed and since the Martyr's Handling stat is already so high, I don't think we need too much more Handling here. Let's look for Velocity-based barrels and since there's only two available magazines, that choice is easy ;)
* **(PvP) Super Picky (1.5% chance)**: Elemental Capacitor's +Reload and +Handling buffs (Solar and Arc respectively) are pheneomenal attributes to bump on breach load launchers.

## Martyr's Retribution - PvE
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker (5.3% chance)**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...

## Patron of Lost Causes - PvP / PvE
CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). Since this is a controller wishlist, these rolls are all about maxing Stability. All of these PvP rolls would be perfectly fine rolls in PvE as well.

## Perfect Paradox - PvE
For PvE, [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) likes Demolitionist with Swashbuckler or Rampage for a large damage boost.
Trench barrel has been nerfed to the point where there are better options but it could be worth picking one up in case the perk gets revived.
There are also better One-Two Punch shotguns, but it wouldn't be a bad secondary perk if you're at s92.
For PvP, he likes Slideshot with Opening Shot or Rampage and  [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA2gxu6OIUI) agrees with him.
* **(PvP) Super Picky (otherwise there are better options) (0.5% chance)**: Range and Rampage or Opening Shot

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvP
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky Straight-Up Recoil (0.3% chance)**: We're looking to max Stability and Range after maxing recoil. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are gravy.

  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Max Range (1.3% chance)**: Most of our stability will come from Firmly Planted so lets use the barrels and magazines to push out the range.
  ```

  Mags    [ 78%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvE
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvE) Super Picky (10.1% chance)**: How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range and Stability as possible?
  ```

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvP
CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (?!) as well as a combo of Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger, which is a rare combo.  Keep in mind TJ5 doesn't benefit from from the Season 9 R92 additional perk in the last slot, so these rolls are *tough* to get. Recently, True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08) and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls.
* **(PvP) "Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be" 🦹‍♂️ (0.4% chance)**: With an `84` base Stability and two Stability perks in the third and fourth columns, let's focus on increasing Range (not at the cost of Stability).
  ```
  Barrels [ 93%]: Quickdot SAS, Control SAS, Tactic SAS, Shortspec SAS
  Mags    [ 64%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds

  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Tap the Trigger
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW

* **(PvP) "Perfectly Balanced" (Relaxed Magazines) 🦹‍♂️ (0.6% chance)**: Same as the above, minus the magazines. These magazines add very little Range, so we're not missing out on much.

## Traveler's Judgement 5 - PvE
These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Disruption Break, who knew? CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks like Barrier can be applied to sidearms and since Barrier is a shield, Disruption Break will be great to pair with it. If you don't use Disruption Break, you're better off using another Energy weapon with damage-increasing perks.
* **(PvE) Super Picky Shieldbreaker (0.4% chance)**: That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk! We're adding ALH because to use Disruption Break you need to switch to your Kinetic weapon, which means ALH will proc and TJ5 will be reloaded and ready to go.

## Trophy Hunter - PvP
More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the  Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon. I toyed with not even having rolls here but it's easy to farm and only here this season; why not grab a decent roll?
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" 🐲 (1.3% chance)**: Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it doesn't feel so sluggish. I don't know that this makes it some kind of S-Tier sniper but why not give it a shot? Sniping is so personal.

## Trophy Hunter - PvE
CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated). Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance. You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo of the barrel perk and Masterwork.
* **(PvE) "Triple Tap Your Way to Seven" (1.5% chance)**: That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here to be able to do that.
  ```
  Barrels [ 91%]: Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

* **(PvE) Gambit Shieldbreaker (2.7% chance)**: Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.

## Black Scorpion-4sr - PvP
[CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive  Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns). There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92 extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along the way.
* Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
* All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."
* The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range, but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a heck of a lot of Stability."
* Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your base Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
* No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not make-or-break.

Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).
* **(PvP) Absurdly Picky, "Massive Breakdown" Edition (0.1% chance)**: Let's call this the "Massive Breakdown Podcast" roll, since listening to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`. Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance of this roll is... slim.

## Bygones - PvP
You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because, well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Why Bygones? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault! Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls: (1) Strongly consider using a single +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get the Recoil to 94 which is basically straight up and down. Arrowhead Brake will let us do this without a mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range benefits of those other barrels (2) Handling is solid, among the highest of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this (3) With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range, precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off before Slideshot dissipates. If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE). He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW. I am requiring Kill Clip because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.
* **(PvP) Absurdly Picky (0.4% chance)**: Going for maximum Stability here; at least a little bit in every column. If you get this roll, buy both of us a lottery ticket. "But Slif, Range improves accuracy and damage falloff" Check out the ZkMushroom video above and tell me if you think the lack of Range-boosting perks handicaps Bygones here.

The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it, so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

## Bygones - PvE
The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal. Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault. We're going for sustained DPS and maximum range falloff. Stability is already high enough and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage Spec mod on it!
* **(PvE) Super Picky (1.1% chance)**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.
  ```
  Barrels [ 72%]: Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    [ 78%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 40%]: Kill Clip, Rampage
  Perks 2 [ 20%]: Outlaw
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Super Picky (Minus MW) (4.5% chance)**: Same as above, minus the masterwork.
  ```
  Barrels [ 72%]: Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling

  Perks 2 [ 20%]: Outlaw
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Baseline / Future-Proofing (8.0% chance)**: This is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just a standard DPS roll. Without perks in both of these columns, there's not a strong reason to run this in PvE. If this is all you end up getting, fine to hang on to it and hope for an archetype buff at some point.

## Last Perdition - PvP
A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. Lots of resources for this one, including the [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/) [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns). I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and Mercules904 quite a bit in here.
* KK: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more Stability."
* KK: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you feel recoil too much"
* M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"
* M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo. If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
* CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more sluggish. Zen Moment is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is super high at 66.

For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition! Here he is on PC - ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) - and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."
* **(PvP) Absurdly Picky (0.8% chance)**: This will be our generally acceptable classic set of Pulse Rifle rolls.

## Last Perdition - PvE
When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool. It's basically an Energy-slot Bygones-equivalent, so the rolls will be similar. We're going for as much sustained damage output and as much range as we can get. The key difference(s) will be that SUROS weapons have scopes and a different set of magazine options. Yes these are a narrow set of rolls but there's so much competition for the Energy slot you need something spicy to make the cut.
* **(PvE) Super Picky Gunslinger (0.6% chance)**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get. We're going to look for short- and medium-zoom scopes because if you feel you need something longer, you're probably looking at a Scout rifle.
